<p>When you are logged in you should try to find a unregistered ""nickname"" and register it. Once you get that done you can go to #freenode channel and request having a ""Cloak"" applied to your nickname.

<p>I 'm ""expanding"" a bit my blog app, and I came up with the necessity to save a set of values (namely my blog settings) in a place where they could be accessed from every Python module. I came up with the idea of creating a new GAE datastore called Data and save each value as a database tuple. The scheme of the entities looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Data(db.Model):
    name = db.StringProperty(required=True)
    textvalue = db.StringProperty(required=False)
    intvalue = db.IntegerProperty(required=False)
    lastedit = db.DateTimeProperty(auto_add = True)
</code></pre>
<p>I plan to store there stuff like the number of posts per page I want in the homepage, the number of written posts (so I don't have to count them each time I need to) and so on.</p>
<p>I'd like to know your opinions on this. Is it a good practice to do such things? Or should I store the values some other way?</p>

"64431"	""	"cs101 "	"100005175"	"<p>I posted <a href=""http://www.udacity-forums.com/cs101/questions/60158/feedback-on-the-course"" rel=""nofollow"">some feedback</a> which touched on this--I mentioned wanting to really work to be successful--but I'd like to expand on that a bit, here.</p>
<p>I studied math at uni, and if you'd say that a 'weeder course' is one that throws difficult material at students so they must either sink or swim, then nearly all of the classes I took were like this. And because I was able to 'swim', I very much liked the classes being that way, because they forced me to work hard and do my best, and as a result I learnt much more than if the course had moved more slowly in order to ensure that everyone learned the material equally.</p>
<p>Of course, if it were possible to teach the same amount of material, but have more students succeed, then I think that is certainly the right thing to do. But I'm not sure that's always possible. Or, where it is possible, I'm not sure that it's in general within the ability of the professors to do it.</p>
<p>For some online classes like Udacity offers, certainly people may continue trying and studying until they understand, but, realistically, not everyone is going to manage to do it within seven weeks, no matter how well explained or easy the material may be. There may be people who will struggle for seven weeks just trying to understand the first unit. And that's okay, because not everyone must learn at the same rate. But there is not such freedom if you are offering an in-person class at a university.</p>
<p>Basically, we must weigh the benefits of teaching a harder class vs. an easier class. Some people have said before me, here, that if the goal is to teach the most people the most knowledge, then weeding out any people at all is counterproductive. But if resources are scarce--teaching time, for example--then by weeding out a few of the worst performing students, all of the rest might benefit enough that it makes up for it. In a physical university, the people who are weeded out then must take a different class, maybe changing their major or perhaps they will even drop out altogether, and it's a shame, but it would be worse to serve everyone poorly than to serve most better and few poorly or not at all, I think. Certainly people are free to study on their own, but the universities must also limit the resources expended on each student.</p>
<p>The beauty of Udacity, though, is that it can offer classes of comparable difficulty to 'weeder' classes <i>without needing to actually weed out any students</i>. Even if a student is failing every homework assignment, they won't be forced out, and there's no incentive to force them out. So for online classes like this, the value calculus changes. Now you can just teach the best class possible, and continue to iterate until you serve better those who were poorly served at first, because the presence of poorly performing students doesn't hurt those who are performing well. People are free to continue to spend their time trying to learn for as long as they feel it's in their best interests.</p>
<p>So, I think that by all means Udacity should offer courses that are like weeder courses. Throw as much material as possible at students, and see what sticks. But also offer all the explanations and help that are needed to help <i>everyone</i> learn the material. Then, those who can learn the material more easily may continue to have lots of challenging material to study, and those who need more help may get it. And let the path through the course be chosen by the student. Already Udacity is like this--for those students who need no help with the homework, they may choose not to view the 'office hours' videos, and not to request help in the forums. For those who need more help, there are many avenues they may explore. If Udacity continues to build on this, then I think it may combine the best of both options. I hope that it does.</p>"	"answer"	"64092"	"64092"	"2012-04-13 21:24:56.059901+00"	"0"	""	"\N"	"100005175"	"2012-04-13 21:24:56.059901+00"	"85102"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>This deals with centripetal acceleration, which is a topic we didn't cover in class. To try to give you an intuitive feel for centripetal acceleration, let's say you are driving a car around a corner. When is it most likely to skid? Well, when you are going fast or when you are turning sharply. This skid out happens because friction can no longer provide the force necessary to keep you moving on your circular trajectory. </p>
<p>Moving in a circle (even at constant speed) is actually a form of acceleration. Remember, acceleration is changing velocity. Since velocity is a vector with both a size (speed) and a direction, you can actually have acceleration if all you are changing is your direction!</p>
<p>For a pendulum, your direction is changing most rapidly as it swings through the bottom.

<p>--- edit ---<br>
So finally I completely revamped the code to (1) remove some bugs and (2) compare more methods. So now the script reliably compares the performance of the following 4 methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Naive resampling: the simplest and least performing method (in O(n^2))</li>
<li>Naive Binary-search: for each i=1..N, the search is now done with a binary search (complexity is now O(n.log(n))</li>
<li>Wheel: Sebastian's method</li>
<li>Wheel-modified: here, index is initialized at 1 and 2*omega_max is replaced by 2/N</li>

<p>Performance is measured according to 3 types of metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distances: there are 3 of them (1) Sum (A(i) - B(i))^2 ; (2) Sum A(i)*|A(i)-B(i)| ; (3) Kullback divergence(A,B)</li>
<li>Miss rate: the %age of particles that have not survived to the resampling, despite having a &gt;0 importance weight</li>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Sebastian's wheel method seems to perform quite similarly to the Naive-Binary method (which is confirmed by repeating the experience a good many times).<br>
<strong>Conclusion 2</strong>: The modified wheel resampler seems to perform a bit better than the original version: distance with the original omega is lower, it ""misses"" fewer particles (on average 5% less) and is much quicker. </p>
<p>To better understand the meaning of the metrics, I killed the Naive method (too slow) and added a null sampler which simply produces the initial sample (ie the re-sampler distribution is uniform over the initial particle set) ; this should give, for all 3 distance metrics,  a view of what a very poor sampling method does. Here is the outcome for N=50,000:</p>
<pre><code>Omega          |         N |  N * mean | N * stDev |   N * min |   N * max 
               :     50000 |  1.000000 |  1.003655 |  0.000031 | 12.279639

</code></pre>
<p>Again, the modified wheel resampler seems to perform better than the original one from all standpoints.</p>
<p>Finally, I ran the same tests with values for the step that replaces Sebastian's 2*omega_max : alpha/N for alpha=0.5,1,2,3,etc. Clearly, 2/N yields the best performance (best distance and best miss rate) of all tested values. Below is the script's output for alpha=0.5, 1, 2, 4:</p>

<p>Summary of all the specific python stuff learned: <a href=""http://www.udacity.com/file?file_key=agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckcLEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMTAxDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GNn3FAwLEgxBdHRhY2hlZEZpbGUYmPccDA"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a></p>
<p>So I'm realizing that this is really a very broad range of topics. Knowing basic data structures and control flow, there's a lot of directions. One thing that came to mind was a sudoku solver, which is boring, but not a trivial problem either. The most intuitive thing might be to adapt the web crawler into something more efficient or maybe to find things other than links. Or maybe a really simple cryptography exercise in using hash tables to encode and decode messages.</p>
<p>One thing that I now noticed wasn't covered cause of the way assignments had to be accepted is getting user input. In python it's really simple, if you type out </p>
<p><code>name = raw_input(""Enter your name: "")</code> </p>
<p>the user will be prompted for input and it'll automatically be stored in the variable name. </p>
<p>Kudos to you if you managed to read all the way to this line.</p>"	"question"	"\N"	"\N"	"2012-04-01 07:10:51.046048+00"	"0"	"(wiki)"	"\N"	"100006877"	"2012-04-01 07:10:51.046048+00"	"70026"	"\N"	"\N"	"240"	"f"

Your result is something similar to the arithmetic mean (the sum of all elements divided by how many they are). </p>
<p>The median is different, it's the number in the middle, out of the three given numbers (it is used, for example, in some statistics, to estimate the average of something very quickly, without much computing=,</p>
<p>So your code needs to look for the one number out of the three that isn't the biggest nor the smallest. </p>
<p>By the way, the median of, say, five, or any other odd number of numbers is also the number in a middle. If the number of numbers is even, say 6, the median is the arithmetic mean of the middle two.

"65360"	""	"cs101 "	"100008221"	"<p>Why aren't more people using Lisp? Well, I'd give a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>First, out of habit (er, well, it could be argued that the next two-three ones are also about habit. Oh well). Lisp traditionally was a academic, AI-research language, used where computer resources were less controlled than in the industry. ""A Lisp programmer knows the value of everything and the cost of nothing"", and all that. Lisp systems could afford to waste cycles and memory, since for the AI researchers, the benefit and pure power of expression was the thing. In the industry, computers were used for mundane, repetitive tasks. Lisps expressive power was not needed, and it was too expensive in machine resources. Nowadays, those things are no longer relevant (the Lisp compilers are heaps better, the resources are plentiful, etc) but ""Real systems programming"" is still using languages from the legacy that came from Algol - Pascal - C - C++ and so on. Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM - That kind of thing</p>
<p>Secondly, because writing Lisp is Different(tm). Most computer languages give you a set of blocks, and programming is a matter of putting those blocks together to solve your problem. It is conceptually a bounded environment. Lisp gives you the tools to build your own blocks, and the problem rather becomes one of deciding what blocks would be useful to solve this problem, and then inventing them. What Kilaws talks about when he (?) talks about Lisp being a language to build languages in. It is of course possible to write Lisp programs that mirror more conventional programming styles, but to get to the power of the language, this is where you need to go. And that is a very different way of thinking. The language that is most similar to this style, I think, is Forth.</p>
<p>Thirdly, because the work environment is different. Lisp is (these days) usually programmed interactively and interpreted - A bit like Python, if you use something like IDLE, where you write your code file in one window and test it out at the Python prompt. Only, in Lisp you can do everything from there. You start off writing a few functions to try things out, write a few test cases. Crash out, and interactively debug your code (inspecting variable values at the crash site, back up or go forward, change a function definition in the running program and continue) Identify some common patterns that you abstract into a macro. Load a profiling package that you've written earlier and attach it to your already written functions. Find out that most of the time is spent in two particular functions, so you compile them to get a bit of performance boost. And so on. The functions you've written, the debugger, the compiler - Everything is at your fingers, interactively, at the prompt.  This is also very different, if you're used to the write-compile-test cycle with an external debugger, a compiler that compiles all or nothing, and so on. </p>
<p>Fourthly, because Lisp has so long been a part of academia, there hasn't really been development in the directions that other languages went. A general use language these days has a large standard library, access to GUI tools, stuff like that. It took a long time for Lisp to get these things (insofar as it still has them), because, well...academics... :D The situation is better today, but for a long time it has been behind in the glitz'n'gui departments.</p>
<p>Fifthly (is that even a word?), there is the heretical thought that maybe, just maybe, that power and expressivity isn't all that important in the real world, really. I shudder to write it down, but maybe it isn't really that good? Oh, who am I trying to fool - Of course it is :-)</p>"	"answer"	"64560"	"64560"	"2012-04-14 18:41:45.921058+00"	"4"	""	"\N"	"100008221"	"2012-04-14 18:41:45.921058+00"	"86384"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>For example, right now there is a thread concerning HW 4.5, our ""Better Splitter"" HW assignment. You can very clearly identify the difference in thinking in the main issue this thread is concerned about:</p>
<p>Namely, is the SPACE considered a special character? Well, to humans (and non-programmers ;) the space IS special because it represents the LACK of something. But the programmer realizes this is an illusion and that to the COMPUTER, there is no difference other than in a bit pattern. IOW, the COMPUTER simply ""sees"" a space as ANOTHER character (and so does the programmer) but a non-programmer thinks of a space as something being missing.</p>
<p>This is a VERY simple example, but if you go with it for awhile, you'll see that there are literally millions of little things like this that a non-programmer wouldn't consider, but a programmer does. An experienced programmer will not be fooled by these little ""gotchas"" and edge cases and such because she's SEEN them before...she DOES think differently than a non-programmer.</p>"	"answer"	"41246"	"41246"	"2012-03-18 13:05:13.725174+00"	"2"	""	"\N"	"100004586"	"2012-03-18 13:05:13.725174+00"	"54476"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

Yes, the human body does generate heat. Yes, that heat <em>could</em> be used as a source of energy. But in order to generate heat, the body must be supplied energy (food), and the amount of energy in that food will always be greater than the amount that could be gained from using the heat produced. The aliens should have just used whatever they were feeding the humans as their energy source. Unless I'm forgetting part of the movie.</p>
<p>As to what you said: Charge does flow in our bodies. Small electric fields are created in our bodies. There is energy in these fields. But to create these fields we need to expend more energy than we could reclaim from the field. </p>
<p>Energy transformations are inefficient. The human body is particularly bad. When we want to get some energy from somewhere, we want to transform that energy as few times as possible. </p>
<p>For example, think back to unit 4. A windmill can be used to do mechanical work (like lifting water out of the Netherlands) or it can be used to generate electrical power, which can THEN be converted to mechanical energy. This second option is less efficient than the first, since some energy is ""lost"" to heat in the transformation from mechanical energy (the spinning windmill) to electric energy and then more is lost in the transformation from electric back to mechanical (the turning screw). </p>
<p>Long story short: the matrix is a great movie built on a ridiculous premise. Great question.</p>

"63849"	""	"cs101 "	"100008230"	"<p>In the old days, in London or New York, the gentlemen's clubs were very powerful social organizations.  Those inside -- even if just the nephew of a member -- had powerful advantages over anyone on the outside, no matter what their personal qualities or skills.</p>
<p>Ivy League and world-class universities have functioned in much the same way, though sometimes more subtly.  Success in business has often been a matter of who you know rather than what you know.  Mere technical mastery would relegate you to the working class.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship has offered a way to leapfrog into the upper ranks, at least to the extent that the nouveau riche can ever do so.  And computer science has offered a new and easy path to entrepreneurship, for those with chutzpah and entrepreneurial spirit.  Now Udacity and the like are offering an easy path into computer science.</p>
<p>But is that enough to compete with what one finds at Stanford?  In theory, yes.  In practice, I think the answer is ""seldom.""  To put it rather crudely, you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear -- nor can you make an entrepreneur out of a computer geek (Bill Gates excepted).  Stanford is in the business of screening out all but the most likely students to succeed, then nurturing them in an environment that demands initiative and expects success.  Some few of those graduates will go on to make major contributions to the endowment fund; hopefully the rest will have useful and satisfying lives.</p>
<p>Udacity certainly has the power to put isolated students on a path to greatness.  (For that matter, so does the Internet.  Or books.  Or a wealthy patron.  Or one good teacher.)  But for typical cases, online education lacks some important elements.</p>
<p>First is the screening.  Large universities use their introductory chemistry classes (or some other difficult course) to weed out the weak, from a student body that was carefully selected to begin with from valedictorians and high school/prep school leaders.  Udacity's CS101 has likewise whittled us down to perhaps as few a 100 students, judging from forum page views, but starting from a less-screened pool.  Yes, Udacity has worldwide reach, and hence will tap brilliance and expertise beyond Stanford's reach.  But still, the output of an online education will typically resemble the input of a Stanford education.</p>
<p>Second is the poor teaching often found at a large research university.  As grateful as we are for Dave's good instruction, let's recognize that Udacity is spoonfeeding us.  A short lecture, an easy quiz, a short test, all with feedback as to the right way to work the problems.  Step by step, we are lead to a packaged conclusion.  It is as if the instructor pulled out a favorite piece of code and spent the next seven weeks stepping us through the modules and statements and concepts.  Yes, it is educational, but in the end we learn only a little beyond that one piece of code.  Any school has to do much the same, but most will require far more book reading and lab work.  Further, bad teaching encourages independent student effort.  Students band into study groups for survival, and must sometimes prepare themselves for the final exam almost in spite of the instructor's efforts to draw them into his/her own research specialty.  The dynamics are complex and different for each class and student, but tend to inculcate social and educational skills you won't get from Udacity forums.</p>
<p>As @charlzz mentioned, there is also the issue of living at home instead of in a dorm.  My father was a professor, so I lived at home as an undergraduate.  It was a mistake.  I needed the experience of living with others of my own age and circumstances.  Not being social, I had little contact with other students outside class.  I remained a nerd.  And my grades suffered as well, though as an individual I was smart enough.  I like to think that I have turned out well, but I know that my poor socialization (originating in grade school and unrecognized ADHD) put me on the wrong path.  I wonder if Udacity isn't offering the same to most of its students.</p>"	"answer"	"63824"	"63824"	"2012-04-12 20:48:21.337582+00"	"1"	""	"200048"	"100005415"	"2012-04-12 21:45:53.014449+00"	"84371"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

Usually inverting a matrix can be a cumbersome task if done by hand, but consider that a normal PC will invert a non-sparse matrix of a thousand rows and colums in few milliseconds. Moreover, since the properties of the matrix (i.e. the fact that it is very sparse and that the position of non-zero elements) are well known, it is possible to write very efficient inversion algorithms that will perform only the necessary calculations. You could write an ""inverse_sparse_xy"" method that will correctly operate on the known matrix structure and you'd get back to very efficient.

"10010747"	""	"st101 "	"100007855"	"<p>Dear Ken,</p>
<p>Prof Thrun's and my computation for unit31-5 is as follows :-</p>
<p>Priors probabilities P(T=1)=P(T=2)=P(T=3)=1/3</p>
<p>Here P(T=k) (for k=1,2,3) denote the probability of the True location of the car.</p>
<p>The joint probability P(M=3,T=1)=1/3 (computed as 1/3 * 1),  P(M=3,T=2)=1/6 ( computed as 1/3 *1/2) ,  P(M=3,T=3)=0 ( computed as 1/3 * 0). Here we use the independence of 2 events to multiply their probability. Also we assume the player chooses door 2.</p>
<p>The likelihood, P(M=3|T=1)=P(M=3,T=1)/P(T=1)=(1/3)/(1/3)=1</p>
<p>P(T=1|M=3)=P(T=1,M=3)/P(M=3)</p>
<p>We first compute, P(M=3) = P(M=3|T=1)P(T=1) + P(M=3|T=2)P(T=2) + P(M=3|T=3)P(T=3) =  P(M=3,T=1)+P(M=3,T=2)+P(M=3,T=2) = 1/3 + 1/6 + 0 = 1/2 ( this is what I think Prof. Thrun is computing).</p>
<p>Hence <br>
 P(T=1|M=3) = P(M=3,T=1)/P(M=3) = (1/3)/(1/2) = 2/3<br>
 P(T=2|M=3) = P(M=3,T=2)/P(M=3) = (1/6)/(1/2) = 1/3<br>
 P(T=3|M=3) = P(M=3,T=3)/P(M=3) = 0/(1/2) = 0</p>
<p>My computation,using Baye's Rule is like this:-</p>
<p>Prior Probabilities are as above.<br>
Likelihood probabilities:-<br>
P(M=3|T=1) = 1<br>
P(M=3|T=2) = 1/2<br>
P(M=3|T=3) = 0<br>
The above is conditional to the player choosing door 2.<br>
Now we want the Posterior distributions,P(T=k|M=3),k=1,2,3.</p>
<p>P(T=k|M=3) = P(M=3|T=k)P(T=k)/P(M=3) for k=1,2,3. ---(i)</p>
<p>P(M=3)=P(M=3|T=1)P(T=1)+P(M=3|T=2)P(T=2)+P(M=3|T=3)P(T=3)=1.(1/3)+(1/2).(1/3) + 0.(1/3) = 1/2</p>
<p>Hence,by using (i),</p>
<p>P(T=1|M=3)=1.(1/3) / (1/2) = 2/3<br>
P(T=2|M=3)=(1/2)(1/3) / (1/2)=1/3</p>
<p>Now that I typed it out I think both the methods are the same. I would love to hear anyone's thought's on this. To me, Prof Thrun's quick method of dividing by the sum was not obvious,but now I think even he is simply using Baye's Rule.

<p>However, Dave was about to add more code after that loop in order to address the case that keyword wasn't found in index. If he HAD used break instead of return, that index.append([keyword, [url]]) line after the for-loop would have been executed even when the keyword WAS found, which would give a duplicate keyword entry in index. </p>

"184"	""	"cs101 "	"100008243"	"<p>It would be best to have all of these ideas rolled into a single community wiki, so here we go:</p>
<p><strong>Website/Videos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pop-up Python interpreter to follow along with the code in the videos.</li>
<li>When watching a video, if you click the ""Class List"" link at the top of the page, the list is brought up behind the video.</li>
<li>Showing the length of each video would be helpful in that it would allow students to allocate their time more appropriately and know how many videos they have time to watch. Also, showing the total video time for a given unit would be nice.</li>
<li>Having the introduction video start each time I load the ""course content"" page is very annoying. This should be changed so that the first video brought up is the next one I need to watch (or the previous one I watched, if I didn't finish it) and even then the video shouldn't start automatically.</li>
<li>Show the number of students registered for each course.</li>
<li>Localized times visible so people in different coutnries know when new lectures will be posted and when assignments/tests are due in their time zone.</li>
<li>Better instructions on how to access and complete quizzes. Quite possibly a full step-by-step tutorial would make the process easier.</li>
<li>An <strong>optional</strong> auto-play feature that will go from one video to another without user interaction.</li>
<li>Reference numbers for each video so that they may be easily tagged in questions on the forums.</li>
<li>Expected hours of work required for any given unit.</li>
<li>Summary video/section for each unit.</li>
<li>It would be nice to have an email sent out to all students when there is an important update to the site, such as a new homework assignment being posted.</li>
<li>When doing quizzes you are immediately given the answers if you get the question wrong even one time. This should be changed with an option to view the answers.</li>
<li>A more visible link to the forums is desirable; perhaps next to the 'Progress' link?</li>
<li>The importance of case (upper/lower) and white space in Python is not discussed.</li>
<li>Progress bars and game-like mechanics (see KhanAcademy) would be cool.</li>
<li>'To learn more'-type link at the end of a video for those bold enough to want more.</li>
<li>Mobile support, make the site more accessible for mobile devices.</li>
<li>A calendar for each course would be really cool. Populate it with the dates of homework assignments, new videos, tests, etc.</li>
<li>Because the videos are hosted on YouTube, they are unavailable from more than a few countries. How about a mirror site where the videos can be downloaded?</li>
<li>The emails sent regarding updates in questions contain bad links.</li>
<li>PDF version of homework assignment similar to that of the course notes.</li>
<li>Khan Academy style quizzes/homeworks. This stems from the idea that mastery is better determined by continuing to do problems until you get enough right, as opposed to simply getting a homework questions right or wrong.</li>
<li>Different video speeds are a great idea. Not everything will be new to all students and some students may need to go slower than others. The ability to play the video at 0.75x, 1.00x, and 1.50x speed would be very useful.</li>
<li>A list of software that would be beneficial to students taking the course (such as <a href=""http://python.org/getit/"" rel=""nofollow"">where to download Python 2.7</a> and <a href=""http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments"" rel=""nofollow"">which IDE to use</a>) would be tremendously helpful to new students with little programming background.</li>
<li>Until the answer videos are actually available, the 'Next' button should take students to the next question.</li>
<li>Links to additional exercises would be good for students who want to go above and beyond.</li>
<li>A single account for the main website and all forums would be ideal.</li>
<li>Fractional answers to quizzes/homework should be accepted.</li>
<li>In addition to auto-play, an auto buffer next video, if current has finished buffering option, if possible would be nice. With my slow internet, I'd have to open the next video in a new tab for it to start buffering after the current one has finished.</li>
<li>Add some (more)text in the instructor comments. The summary of the video from the units lecture notes would be just fine. Would give people with a slow internet with something to do while the video buffers. Though if you take a look at the <a href=""http://worrydream.com/Tangle/"" rel=""nofollow"">Tangle javascript library</a>, it would be nice if you could incorporate that into the instructor comments. Would make for nice, interactive notes that would add to the experience of learning.</li>
<li>Make it possible after due date to view the answer one submitted to the homework (to see if one forgot to click submit, or to see if maybe some modifications were made after due date which make it impossible to see why the homework was graded incorrect in retrospect)</li>
<li>Re-do the video lecture on TraceRoute (4.17) as there were many mistakes (192.168.1.1 being described as local host, not realizing that traceroute shows roundtrip delay, etc.) Re-do the homework question (4.4) that asks about latency to Cambridge from Palo Alto. Routers don't cause as much latency as the question assumes. The question and ""right"" answer are invalid because they are based on the misunderstanding about traceroute and roundtrip time. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Forums</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More intuitive formatting. Making this list caused me a great deal of annoyance.</li>
<li>Provide an option to show which courses a user is currently registered in/has previously completed.</li>
<li>The ability to message other users on the forum is definitely needed. </li>
<li>Optional subscribing to threads as opposed to the current auto-subscribing.</li>
<li>Actually limit daily voting. I currently have -2 votes left for today and can still vote on posts.</li>
<li>Make the FAQ button larger and more noticeable. Perhaps stick it on the bar with the links 'Questions', 'Tags', 'Users', etc.</li>
<li>Attempting to sort questions by 'hottest' gives a 504 error.</li>
<li>Community wiki's aren't editable by another other than the creator, despite karma. A short explanation should be given. - <strong>[This appears to be false]</strong></li>
<li>More than one answer can be accepted for any thread.</li>
<li>Karma is not rewarded when your comment gets voted up.</li>
<li>Suggest the use of standardized tags for commenting on homeworks/quizzes such as HW1.9, to help avoiding the multiplication of same questions on the same topic.</li>
<li>Consolidate forums with other courses?</li>
<li>Enable sticky posts for currently frequently asked questions, so the forums aren't spammed with 100 variations of the same problem.</li>
<li>There should be options to flag a question as 'Non-constructive' and 'Possible duplicate', in addition to the already available options.</li>
<li>A separate forum should exist for threads of general, non-course related discussions. This will have the added bonus of not clogging up the course forums with irrelevant material.</li>
<li>Having the formatting details shown when writing comments would be helpful.</li>
<li>Rather than requiring a separate account for each forum, link forum access to course enrollment and maintain posting statistics across courses.</li>

<br>obviously I am not an expert, so I don't dare saying Skiena is right or wrong.<br>
<br>Accordingly to what he says in his book, given a graph and a value k, it is possible to verify if k is the chromatic number of a graph in expected constant time. Therefore it would mean the problem is in NP.<br>
<br>Perhaps that ""expected"" could make a difference or not, but I believe Skiena is a much more reliable source than myself.<br>
<br><br>
<br>EDIT: on second thought, if the worst case is exponential, that would mean that at least one certificate could not be verified in poly time, which would make the problem not be in NP. And in such case either my interpretation of the book or the book itself is wrong.</p>"	"comment"	"11004731"	"11004305"	"2012-08-08 08:04:28.85856+00"	"0"	""	"11038375"	"100022094"	"2012-08-08 08:09:15.483216+00"	"11007100"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>One minor thing: when you move to take the standard deviation of x, it's still written as x(i) in the equation, which confused me at first.

"37922"	""	"cs101 "	"100008230"	"<p>I was thinking that we shouldn't include the HW4.6 modification because of the order in which the homework problems were presented.  If you wanted to include both of the modifications, it would make sense to implement click counts first, then modify that code to save only unique urls.  Then each problem need be solved only once.  In the order presented, the click counts have to be implemented one way in HW4.6 and then a different, more complex, way in HW4.7.  Doesn't make sense from a pedantic standpoint, and if it really were intended the instructions should have pointed out the need for modifying both routines.  It seems (or seemed) more likely that only the uniqueness modification is desired.</p>
<p>But Tomas's comment is correct: the HW4.7 answer can't be right in a real-world application if counts could be assigned arbitrarily to any of several urls.  Either the url should be made unique, as in HW4.6, or we are relying on the code to always increment the first instance and ignore all counts for duplicate keyword-url pairs.  The latter approach has possible uses, but we would use a different data structure instead of storing all those unreachable counts.  Clearly the instructor is heading toward the first option of having only unique urls for each keyword.</p>
<p>Both lines of reasoning seem valid, but useful function trumps pedantic elegance.  I'll go with including both modifications unless we get guidance otherwise.</p>

The thing about it is that majority of them falls into only few categories of repeating the same type of mostly silly mistakes. Thus, it looks as a good idea to collect them somewhere in order for everyone to be able to learn from that resource and do not make the same mistake again.</p>
<p>I will start with the ones I remember just from the top of my head and feel free to edit this post and add yours ""lessons learned"" (I am marking this post as community wiki in order for everyone to be able to directly edit it.):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read the assignment very carefully and do exactly what you were asked for</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If it says ""print number of seconds"", do not print string ""Number of seconds is: %d"". Print only that number, you were asked for. Also make sure you looked at the comments under the video and that you really understand what you are supposed to do (e.g. this was my problem for the first question, where I did not notice the HTML below the video and simply marked all URL's, which had valid format).</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distinguish between ""print"" and ""output""</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>While it is little confusing also for me, because when someone says ""output"", I understand ""print"", by default, this term was very clearly defined in Unit2.3 and following videos. Thus, distinguish between these: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>""print""</strong>: Print out something to standard output (do not confuse standard output a.k.a. <code>stdout</code> with <code>return</code>), i.e. <strong>use call to <code>print</code></strong>.</li>
<li><strong>""output""</strong>: Return something out from the function, i.e. <strong>use call to <code>return</code></strong>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Test, test, test!:</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Make sure you actually test your solution before submitting it. Try to cover especially border cases. Also make sure you test on correct environment, e.g. there are multiple versions of Python and they are not 100% compatible, thus even if you did extensive testing on your local Python installation, run it at least once (try to cover all lines of code) in the embedded online interpreter directly on this site in order to be sure that there are no compatibility issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make sure your output does not contain any extras, such as debug messages and the like</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>As Aleksey P stated in one of the threads, such code is not suitable neither for production nor for homework submission.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make sure you DO NOT REPEAT anything from above the comment</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>This one seems pretty obvious, but it includes also cases, where many homeworks failed, because some variable defined above that comment was overwritten by some hardcoded value below it. In other words, don't copy what is above the comment to below it. If you do this, the grading software can not change the variable and test your code properly.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not hardcode ""magic values""</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If the question says that you have to find second occurrence of the target string and gives an example of search string <code>""De l'audace, encore de l'audace, toujours de l'audace""</code> and target string <code>""audace""</code>, make sure that your code does not look just for the string <code>""audace""</code>. You need to use input argument as a target string, instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not remove comments already there</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Removing comments can mean you remove the place the autograder is using to determine where your code starts so it can't check it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not use Python's built-in identifiers for your own identifiers</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Albeit it will sometimes work (at least somehow) it definitely is not considered a good practice to ""recycle"" programming language's own built-in names (such as Python's <code>str</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>round</code>, <code>max</code>, etc.), because such ""recycled"" identifiers may clash with the original identifiers and produce unexpected or even undefined behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not submit ""multiple answers""</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If the assignment is wants you e.g. to implement a function XYZ and you know more than one solution, choose and submit exactly one of them. I.e. do not submit source code, containing multiple XYZ functions, each of them containing one of your correct solutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Measure twice and cut once</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Before submitting, reread the assignment again, check and recheck all the small details, such as name of the function you created, for the devil is in the details. Better to spend few more seconds on rechecking your work than be sorry after homework was graded.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check your homework few hours before deadline</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It may happen, that some new hints will have appeared after your submission. It might be a good idea to check it and eventually rethink your answer if that is the case. Make sure that you do not resubmit wrong answer, though (e.g. in case you ran the code you do not want to be submitted as answer, recheck that it was not saved by some accident, etc. - see ""measure twice and cut once"" hint above).</p>

the solution D Kulakovsky posted above is exactly the way I solved the problem. Once you get to that disequality, you can find the correct minimum integer value (bigger than 1) that solves the problem by testing with different numbers. At some point you will find a couple of values (say n_0, n0+1) such that for n0 the disequality is not satisfied but for n0+1 it is. The value n0+1 is the value required</p>"	"comment"	"11004675"	"11004569"	"2012-08-08 00:59:44.059632+00"	"0"	""	"11038278"	"100022094"	"2012-08-08 01:00:23.605614+00"	"11007068"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>Since I couldn't find another way to post the equations here, I put the literal latex code which can be pasted into <a href=""http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php</a></p>
<hr>
<p>When multiplying the two gaussians, we get some constants term multiplied with some exponential term again. We can ignore the constant term, because that one has to be replaced with a new normalization factor anyway in order to make the result gaussian. The exponential multiply like this:</p>
<pre><code>e^{- {1 \over 2} {(x - \mu)^2 \over \sigma^2} } \cdot e^{- {1 \over 2} {(x - \nu)^2 \over \tau^2} } = e^{- {1 \over 2} \left( {(x - \mu)^2 \over \sigma^2} +  {(x - \nu)^2 \over \tau^2} \right ) }
</code></pre>
<p>Now, since the value of the exponent will always be negative, this function will reach its peak when the value in the parentheses is minimal. To calculate this minimum, we need to find the value x for which the first derivative is zero:</p>
<pre><code>{d \over dx} \left( {(x - \mu)^2 \over \sigma^2} + {(x - \nu)^2 \over \tau^2} \right ) = 2 \left ( {{x-\mu} \over \sigma^2} + {{x - \nu} \over \tau^2}\right ) = 0
</code></pre>
<p>When you solve this for x, you get:</p>
<pre><code>x = {{\nu\sigma^2 + \mu\tau^2} \over {\sigma^2 + \tau^2}}
</code></pre>
<p>This is obviously our new mean, because this is the position of the highest peak in the resulting function.</p>
<p>Now for calculating the variance, we use the fact, that the second derivative of the same term in the exponent of the gaussian function will be 2/sigma_2, which means it's not dependent on x or the mean anymore. So for our new gaussian with mu' and sigma', we should get the following equation:</p>
<pre><code>{{d^2}\over {dx^2}} {\left( {(x - \mu)^2 \over \sigma^2} + {(x - \nu)^2 \over \tau^2} \right )} = {{2\over \sigma^2} + {2 \over \tau^2 }} = {2 \over \sigma'^{2}} = {{d^2}\over {dx^2}} {\left( {(x - \mu')^2 \over \sigma'^2}\right )}
</code></pre>
<p>You can now solve this for sigma' and get the new variance:</p>
<pre><code>\sigma'^2 = {1 \over {{1\over\sigma^2}+{1\over\tau^2} }}
</code></pre>"	"answer"	"1011099"	"1011099"	"2012-03-03 12:19:28.790604+00"	"0"	""	"1043357"	"100003121"	"2012-03-03 12:43:27.685725+00"	"1015288"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

I suspect there are better ways to abuse my body. Am beginning to get comfortable working directly on the screen like my sons do but ensconced in bed, I keep putting off the intricate bits which may require the 'rough book' as we called the scratchpad in my childhood. </p>
<p>One can figure out how to improve efficiency and working convenience - come on Pro's - does it boil down to similar methods for all?? Please enlighten us noobs. A small tutorial on set-up would be welcome.</p>
<p>5 or 6 videos/quizzes within each unit, every day through the week, should take care of the schedule. Conversely, I doubt if I'd have solved the problems without the pressure of a deadline : ) The last two nights have been frustrating due to net issues and inexperience. Gah! Such is life!</p>
<p>HW2.7 submitted 2 minutes past deadline after the internet (my end surprisingly) went off at 2350UTC just as I was getting the nested loops out of the soup. I think there was some system changover from night to day rates. Before that my hotel room in Saudi Arabia had the internet connection unserviceable for the 1.5 days I had to myself over there. Some Murphy that Murphy. HW 2.6 pends.</p>
<p>But . . . I cannot easily replace the wonder at seeing what was once ""required reading"", yes all the way till 'twelve times' in primary school Grade 2 :</p>

"64421"	""	"cs101 "	"100008230"	"<p>I''m going out on a limb here, both because I know so little about you and because I am recommending a path that I have not followed.</p>
<p>You are getting advice to improve your coding skills via classes.  Great, if you can afford the time and cost, but those classes will simply put you in competition with all of the other graduates.  If what you need is a programming job, consider community college classes.  These are often sponsored by local industry and have ties to the local job market.  My wife once took a TAL class for instance -- the language for programming Tandem computers.  Not a big market for that, but there were jobs at Tandem for some of the graduates.  Community college graduates are also good candidates for sysop jobs and other infrastructure positions.  From there you can work your way into other programming positions, if you so choose.</p>
<p>Alternatively, contact local corporations directly and ask about their training programs.  Here's one in today's news: Facebook has just agreed to pay the city of Menlo Park $15M over 15 years for the right to exceed 3,600 on-site employees.  As part of the deal, Facebook has agreed to create a summer internship program for local high school students and to develop a local career training and outreach program; they will also be investing in affordable local housing.</p>
<p>If you can't get into a local training program, perhaps you can be hired for help desk work or some other peripheral task.  Then you can network inside the company and you get first crack at the internal job postings.</p>
<p>Another low-level entry route is to help people or small businesses with their personal computer problems, freelance or with a business service.  You need some skills to get hired for this, of course, but relatively few up-front skills if you freelance -- and it can be done part time.  Retired people sometimes get into computing by volunteering their services to local charities or school clubs, though of course that doesn't generate income.  Anyway, the point is to get started with what you know and then gradually add to your skills, rather than feel that you have to learn a dozen languages and systems up front.  The basic principle of getting hired is to find someone who has a problem and some budget authority, but who can't or doesn't want to do the work him/herself. Managers with problems and time constraints are easy to find, and budget is often available as well.  You just have to be willing to start with the work that no one else wants to do, at unattractive pay, on obsolete systems, in a language no one cares about -- or some subset of the above.  And you have to sell yourself, on your initiative, personality, and potential if not on your skills.  (Skills can be trained, or self-trained.)</p>
<p>In general, I would recommend getting experience over getting a degree.  But talk to some Personnel directors; see what they say.  And ask managers to explain the kind of coding/programming/IT experience they are looking for.  Check with you nearest ACM or IEEE chapters (or equivalent) as well; the officers and members will probably be happy to advise you, even if you are not a member.</p>"	"answer"	"64282"	"64282"	"2012-04-13 21:19:48.15178+00"	"0"	""	"\N"	"100008230"	"2012-04-13 21:19:48.15178+00"	"85089"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

"26924"	"HW2.5 Collatz Conjecture prove attempt"	"cs101 loops hw2.5 collatz conjecture prove"	"100007193"	"<p>The homework 2.5 became very interesting due to its nature... here comes my few pennies to the homework dealing with the Collatz conjecture..</p>
<p>Well, so, we have still few weeks to prove that the serie converges to 1 in order to get the full credits :-)</p>
<p>There are no proves yet, so let's ""propose"" this ;-) ....</p>
<p>OK, so what do we know about the serie? First of all, the serie converges to 1, if the iterated value (or plain) n becomes or is of the power of two (as 1,2,4,etc =&gt; ...,4,2,1).</p>
<p>Therefore for some point of time, regardless how long we calculated, iterated and how many rounds of n we have made in our function, the following statement must be true in order to converge to 1:</p>
<p>3x + 1 = x^2</p>
<p>Therefore, if this is ""not true or it cannot be true"" =&gt; there must be a non-real (complex) number solution to this =&gt; there exists a value that makes our code loop forever.<br>
In other words, the equation must have a solution producing only real numbers, thus having always a real solution.</p>
<p>Note that we are not interested by the x ""or n"" itself in the proving, but the equation only, that it has a solution in the world of real numbers - no imaginary parts/numbers whatsoever. In such an imaginary case, we expect only an eternal loop.<br>
The idea is somewhat like proving that ""the plane 3x+1 cuts the plane x^2"".</p>
<p>From that point of view we need to show that there is always (real) value solution to our equation.</p>
<p>Let's modify the equation a bit</p>
<p>3x + 1 = x^2</p>
<p>=&gt; x^2 - 3x - 1 = 0</p>
<p>=&gt; 1*x^2 - 3x - 1 = 0</p>
<p>Remember from math lessons that:<br>
ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a is not 0</p>
<p>=&gt; x = (-b [+-] sqrt(b^2 - 4<em>a</em>c))/2*a</p>
<p>The square root part (b^2 - 4<em>a</em>c) is called discriminant D.<br>
So, these holds:</p>
<p>( 1 ) if D &gt; 0, then the equation has two real value solutions x1, x2 (ok in our case, as we need to show that there exists a real value solution whatever n is)</p>
<p>( 2 ) if D = 0, then the equation has a doubled solution x1 = x2 (ok in our case as above)</p>
<p>( 3 ) if D &lt; 0, then the equation does not have real number solutions =&gt; meaning that there are not any chances to solve our problem, i.e. there exists a value n that is not real (ie., complex)), ""the planes do not cut"", and that causes the eternal loop</p>
<p>So, for our purpose it is enough to show that the discriminant is equal or bigger than 0 to be sure that our loop stops.</p>
<p>To apply that info to our equation:</p>
<p>x = (-(-3) [+-] sqrt( (-3)^2 - 4<em>1</em>(-1) ) ) / ( 2 * 1 )</p>
<p>=&gt; x = ( 3 [+-] sqrt( 9 - (-4) ) ) / 2</p>
<p>=&gt; x = ( 3 [+-] sqrt(9+4) ) / 2</p>
<p>=&gt; x = ( 3 [+-] sqrt(13) ) / 2</p>
<p>=&gt; x1 = ( 3 + sqrt(13) ) / 2<br>
=&gt; x2 = ( 3 - sqrt(13) ) / 2</p>
<p>Discriminant D = 13<br>
=&gt;<br>
A) because D is positive, there always is a real number solution =&gt; the loop (n) converges always at some point of time to 1 via the squared serie. ""The planes cuts each other""</p>
<p>B) because D is not negative (solution is not a complex number), does not loop forever, i.e., converges always to 1 meaning that while loop stops at some point of time with whatever n is.</p>
<p>There is always a real solution to our ""3x + 1 = x^2"" equation, meaning that the 3x+1 plane cuts the squared plane (x^2) at some point and the loop ends via the serie of (.., 4, 2, 1). The equality proves the cutting of the planes.</p>
<p>3 * (( 3 + sqrt(13) ) / 2) + 1 == (( 3 + sqrt(13) ) / 2) ^ 2)</p>
<p>10.908... == 10.908...</p>
<p>Proved.</p>
<p>... or...<br>

<p>First: yes, I took this course, but not in the same way that all of you probably have. Part of my job is to review the units after they are edited, which means I have to go through every video, make sure there are no obvious content or editing mistakes, and then start putting together the quizzes and programming exercises. The review phase has to happen quickly, which means I don't always get to attempt each programming exercise before I have to watch the solution video.</p>
<p>That being said, I tried to solve as many programming exercises and homework problems as I could squeeze in.</p>
<p>Was this course easy? No! But I love challenging courses, so I had a really fun time solving the problems that I did. There would also be occasions when I would be watching a solution video and be so excited by the elegance of a solution that I would pause, call over all the Udacity engineers, and show the solution to them. For example, the function which creates a scrabble board from only 1/4 of a board in unit 6 is something that I really appreciated. Physicists love symmetry, and I really liked that Peter was able to identify a symmetry in this problem and use it to his advantage. When I called the engineers over for this one the office basically stopped working for 30 minutes while we discussed it. </p>
<p>As far as my experience before this: I am very new to both Python and programming in general. Before Udacity, my programming experience was limited to some basic matlab scripts to analyze data and fit curves. In February I TA'ed CS 373 and took CS 101 and learned a lot through those courses and through discussions with Peter Chapman (one of the other TAs). So yes, I learned a TON of new tricks (some of which I posted on Andy's Corner and the Python Glossary, which I hope were helpful for the students who were new to programming). Generator expressions, decorators, and memoization are some of my favorite new 'tricks.'</p>
<p>I think the three biggest take aways from this course for me are the importance of selecting the right representation for a problem (as in, should I model this as a set? A list of lists? A string?); the necessity of planning when solving big problems; and the importance of modularity in code. The functions that I write now are much shorter, accomplish one specific task, and are therefore much more modular, useful, and easy to debug than they used to be.</p>

<p>You bring up a good point, and it's one we've thought a lot about. There is definitely a tradeoff between showing solutions immediately versus waiting. The compromise we've decided on is to show solutions during <em>lectures</em>, but to delay showing solutions on <em>homework</em>. You can always force yourself not to view the lecture solution videos (though I know that the ""solution"" button can be pretty tempting when you are stuck on a problem).</p>"	"answer"	"5008460"	"5008460"	"2012-05-08 18:42:52.00822+00"	"2"	"(accepted)"	"\N"	"100028529"	"2012-05-08 22:09:25.809942+00"	"5012111"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"t"

<p>Rather than trying to answer all those posts individually, here's a guide.  I hope it helps.  Please, anyone, jump in with corrections, suggestions, exceptions, etc.  This is marked community wiki.</p>
<p><strong>Print, or Not?</strong></p>
<p>There are 3 possible situations in this class, thus far:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The quiz/homework wants you to <em>write a procedure</em> that ""returns"" or ""outputs"" or ""produces"" some specific result.  That means your procedure, beginning with the 'def' statement, will have one or more 'return' statements somewhere (often at the end).  You will write the desired result immediately following the 'return' word, as in, 'return p'.  When that 'return' is executed, the result will ""return"" or ""output"" BACK to the program line that ""called"" (used) the procedure.  There is NO printing involved.  DO NOT use a 'print' anywhere!  The auto-grader, which is itself a program, will call (use) your procedure, and check that it gives back the right result.  This is probably the most common case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quiz/homework wants you to <em>write a program</em> that prints some specific result -- the wording will say ""print"" explicitly.  The context should be clear that it's the PROGRAM doing the printing, NOT a procedure.  Thus, even if writing a procedure is involved, any 'print' statements go OUTSIDE your procedures.  DO NOT put a 'print' anywhere inside a procedure in this case!  Do the printing in the body of the program, not indented under a 'def'.  The auto-grader will run your entire program, and look to see that the right result is printed out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quiz/homework wants you to <em>write a procedure</em> that prints some specific result.  The wording will explicitly say to write or make a procedure, and have it print something.  In this case, you put the 'print' statements INSIDE the procedure, somewhere under the 'def'.  There need not be any result returned if all the procedure must do is print something.  However, it's possible for a procedure to do both:  print something, and also return a result.  Read carefully to clarify.  The auto-grader will call your procedure, and check that it prints out the right result.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Other situations are possible, but these are what we've seen so far, as far as I can remember.  If a more complicated case comes up, try to figure it out by breaking apart the problem into a combination of two or more of these three cases.</p>
<p>One other note:  it's a good idea to use temporary 'print' statements liberally for testing.  Put them any place in your programs and procedures that helps you figure out if what you wrote works correctly.  But don't forget to remove them again before submitting!</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If the problem is to ""write a procedure"" that ""outputs"" or ""returns"" or ""produces,"" then NO 'print' should appear anywhere.  Use a 'return' to complete the procedure.</li>
<li>If the problem is to ""write a program"" that ""prints"" something, your 'print' statements go OUTSIDE any procedures.</li>
<li>If the problem is to ""write a procedure"" that ""prints"" something, your 'print' statements go INSIDE the procedure.</li>

<p>Thanks for asking about Saylor.org! I'm the Community &amp; External Affairs Manager for the Saylor Foundation, and wanted to fill you in on a couple of aspects about Saylor.org. </p>
<p>Regarding our business model: we are an operating 501(c)(3) Foundation. It is our mission to provide all of our educational courses and associated resources (like textbooks, our ePortfolio, and more) for free. We will never charge our students to take a course or for a certificate of completion.</p>
<p>And to Vincin's point about universities offering credits for these free educational resources, we are working to make that happen for students that are interested in formal credits. This year, we've announced partnerships with StraighterLine and Excelsior College that will allow students to take select courses at Saylor.org and then pay a small fee to either StraighterLine or Excelsior to take a credit-bearing exam built upon those particular courses. If you have any questions about our efforts to build college credit partnerships, you can send an email to Devon Ritter who's heading up our student/credit partnerships effort at devon.ritter@saylor.org.</p>
<p>Thanks, and best of luck with your studies!</p>

The majority of all business metrics visualisations are bar charts (or line charts incorrectly used instead of bar charts), because you want to know how metrics change over time.</p>

"28528"	"Homework2.5: Bonus Question"	"cs101 collatz-conjecture hw2.5 homework"	"100008647"	"<p>I spent last hour or so reading various comments on homework question 2.5.3 and I am under impression, that some kind of union will eventually form and then declare a general strike of some sort. :) So I have a bonus question for HW2.5:</p>
<p>Why are you taking this course?</p>
<p>a) To get (arguably useless) sheet of paper with some numbers and signatures on it.</p>
<p>b) To learn something.</p>
<p>In case your answer was a), then please note that at least for now (I can't predict future though and actually I hope they will manage something like that), that sheet of paper is virtually useless, since Udacity has no accreditation (and as far as I know they are not searching to obtain any, but again, I can be mistaken). Moreover, if I was an employer (in fact I was for a time and I hardly looked at resumes and formal education of candidates - partially because of the poor state of universities in this part of the world and partially because of I prefer to trust what I see myself, not what others tell to me I should believe.), I would not give such a paper any credit, since it can not be proved that you earned it yourself and you were not helped by some friend or so - Internet is very strange place to be, in this respect.</p>
<p>I can second the motion:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>that the partial scoring would be ""more fair"" (but how is ""fair"" defined and what actually is ""fair"", after all?),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that it is not the best practice to change assignments (hints and function definitions added) after they were aired and already solved by many,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that this question was tricky and should have been part of quiz, rather than homework, or at least homework in some later unit</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, when rising up such motions, one should notice also those four letters to the right of the ""Udacity"" logo at each page (saying ""BETA""). In fact, Udacity had only one experience with such an endeavour - the Standford AI class. This one is only the second one. That is reason for that ""BETA"" thingie. They are still learning and working around the clock to deal with all day-to-day problems (such as heavy traffic peak due to an article in really popular medium). They are also only people such as me and you and they need to do a few mistakes before ""BETA"" can go away. Let's try to give them that opportunity - they need it and I think they deserve it and also that they will do their best to use it. Also, let's not forget that we are getting all of this for <strong>free</strong>!</p>
<p>Anyway, I can not help myself, but I think that this was the best question from HW2 - because, as I wrote in my other posts, it gives very little example of how programmers job in real life truly looks like. You are not inventing a wheel most of the time (unless you are a researcher, but that is not typical programmer's job). In case you want to be productive, you do not have that luxury - deadlines are tough, customer does not really know what he wants (it is your job to find out), functional specification is incomplete and sometimes it is also contradicting itself (business analyst is also only a man), code you are working on consists of few million (and more) lines of code and 90% of it looks like the one who wrote it was just in process of learning the language he used, testers are submitting bug tickets saying only ""something is not working"" without any closer specification nor debug trace, 3 from 5 of your key team members get really ill right before the deadline etc etc. Thus you do not have any time to play brain-teasing games. When you need to find a solution to your problem, you search the web (or other resources at hand). And it is usually much harder than HW2.5.3 assignment, because you need to overcome all of the above mentioned problems and still deliver quality code and deliver it on time. Otherwise your customer will not be satisfied and you are risking not getting your salary (even more, if you are a freelancer).</p>
<p>So, my message in short is: <strong>Do not complain about HW2.5.3, because it will not do you any good - you will just waste lots of time - the most valuable of all goods known to humanity. Instead, take it as a great opportunity to learn something...</strong></p>"	"question"	"\N"	"\N"	"2012-03-09 01:30:53.585949+00"	"6"	""	"91694"	"100003289"	"2012-03-09 02:04:45.142943+00"	"37302"	"\N"	"\N"	"255"	"f"

<br>thanks for sharing your opinion as well.

<p>Firstly, the mini-units don't have titles. ""Unit 8 Optional"", ""Unit 9 Optional"", ""Unit 10 Optional"", ... don't make it easy for pick-and-choose-ing.</p>

<p>Having these topics in a separate course, imo, would actually greatly boost accessibility, boost organization, motivate more students, and much more.

</blockquote>
<p>The statement ""If the list has zero or one elements, it is already sorted."" is referring to your quicksort procedure not to the ordered_search procedure. It is essentially giving you a hint (or rather a very obvious statement) as to the base case of your quicksort procedure. As you pivot and split into 2 lists and then make recursive calls to quicksort, it will eventually happen that either a [] or list with 1 url will get passed to quicksort. </p>"	"answer"	"51360"	"51360"	"2012-04-01 20:42:35.882935+00"	"0"	""	"\N"	"100004414"	"2012-04-01 20:42:35.882935+00"	"70556"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>One topic that I would like to know about, is how to have a global knowledge of what to use when we have several options. <br>
Like, for example, I was very happy when I found out on the web how to use filter, map, and functions like that. But then, few hours later, I've read an article of python creator, saying why not to use them, and his opinion on removing them from the language. So then I began to learn about list comprehensions. <br>
The same goes for how do we know if something is ""well"" implemented in python, in terms of efficiency, like what you mention about recursion.</p>
<p>So, what I mean is, that it seems that Python language evolves fast, and many examples, tests, and documentation on the web a very outdated... and it is not enough to see the date, maybe something that worked a year ago, does not work anymore, or it is no loger the better way to do things.<br>
I dont know if it is possible to do a unit on ""what not to use""... but I dont know how to overcome this issue when learning python, given the randomness of how one finds information on the web.</p>
<p>Dave, it would be nice if you could comment on this.<br>

<p>I think you're talking about the Zebra Puzzle. I'm afraid I don't have any wisdom to shed on this puzzle beyond the statement in class.  The idea of the problem is to start with a very vague statement ""there are five houses,"" in which the number of possible orderings is very large. Then, you impose constraints ""the Englishman lives in the red house."" Each constraint reduces the number of possible orderings until there is only one left. I tried solving this problem without python's help and gave up after 10 mins of trying to keep everything straight.

If there's an 'idea' at all, it's that letting a heap grow by adding smaller stuff at the top doesn't create that much extra work because, since you always add smaller stuff, it's only the top of the heap pyramid that matters.

This set should work the same regardless of improvements made to lookup(). I also
removed some checks of special cases - e.g. calling record_user_click() with
non-existant keywords or urls. See the other set if you want to test these cases.

<p>I do NOT, repeat NOT call downvoting bullying, and I have not asked anyone to abstain from downvoting.</p>
<p>I've asked people to stop bullying people who are simply confused and trying to get questions answered. That's very different, and I'm sorry you can't seem to see the difference.</p>
<p>You're welcome to downvote my post, for example. I presume you already have. I don't object to that at all.</p>
<p>What I'm objecting to is attempts to intimidate people who need help from posting. They may be going about it wrong. They may be doing things which bother you. But they don't deserve to be attacked for it, and if downvoting is <em>part of such an attack</em>, then I object.</p>
<p>If you can't understand such a distinction, then of course you're going to miss the whole point -- and if you're doing that, then I probably can't get you to change your behavior.</p>
<p>But this topic has 50+ votes, so some people get it.</p>
<p>Do feel free to downvote comments that don't contribute to the discussion or answer the question, or do it wrong, or are unclear, whatever.</p>
<p>But don't insult someone for posting a question, and then downvote it. Especially not if they seem lost and clueless!</p>
<p>If the question has no general interest, just don't upvote it. If it is destructive somehow -- like if you took my coding challenge as insulting to Sebastian, vote that down.</p>
<p>Feel free to vote me down whenever you like. I'm pretty much bully-proof.</p>
<p>But please, consider the people behind these posts as <em>people</em>, and treat them with a little respect.</p>
<p>That's all I'm asking for. Not a ban on downvoting. There's no inconsistency here at all.</p>"	"comment"	"1020613"	"1020502"	"2012-03-15 20:08:53.492465+00"	"0"	""	"\N"	"100010063"	"2012-03-15 20:08:53.492465+00"	"1028870"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>In the equation $%F=ma$%, the ""m"" is somehow a measure of how difficult it is too get an object moving. The greater the m, the more difficult it is to accelerate an object. This idea of difficulty-to-move we call inertia. So the m in $%F=ma$% refers to the object's <strong>inertial mass</strong></p>
<p>There is another property that objects have. We can call that property ""How much an object reacts to gravity."" THAT is the m in $%mg$%, and we can call that the <strong>gravitational mass</strong> of an object.</p>
<p>So we have these two ENTIRELY DIFFERENT properties of objects. 1- how hard it is to get an object moving and 2- how much an object responds to gravity. </p>

<p>This coefficient depends, as you would expect, on both the object and the surface: a ball dropped on sand will not bounce as high as a ball dropped on a hard surface.</p>"	"answer"	"9007545"	"9007545"	"2012-08-11 17:20:54.74498+00"	"1"	""	"\N"	"100007518"	"2012-08-11 17:20:54.74498+00"	"9010009"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

From the point of view of someone on the side of the road, when you jump up, you aren't jumping straight up. You also have some horizontal velocity due to the motion of the truck. In fact, you have the same horizontal velocity as your truck! So if the truck is moving at 10 mph, then when you jump up, you are also jumping forward (from their point of view) at 10 mph.  When you land, you and the truck have each moved forward by the same amount, and therefore you land in the same spot on the bed of the truck.</p>
<p>From your point of view: well motion at constant velocity is the same as being at rest.

I reject the argument in the Wikipedia paragraph labeled ""A Common Resolution.""  (There is nothing wrong with the expectation in Step 7, and the alternative formula in terms of X is correct but useless.)  The rest of the arguments I either haven't read or don't understand.  But they seem to hinge on exceedingly fine distinctions, and the randomness of the prize amounts is one of them.</p>
<p>My own preference is to treat them as random variables, as that gives me a handle on probabilistic analysis.  Otherwise the envelopes contain two completely unknown random numbers, and I have no clue from one as to what the other may be.  That's OK for the logical paradox, as the claim is that the two envelopes should be equivalent and thus we must be making an error if we calculate that they are not.  But you posed a different problem, stating that the two choices are not equivalent.</p>
<p>My statement that you quote above does sound very much like the Wikipedia solution, but the interpretation is different.  My approach depends on the number of significant digits; I don't see anything about that in the Wikipedia discussion of Z.  Instead, it is saying that because of the normalized nature of probability distributions, the broader the distribution, the lower the probability of any particular random value (to within its representational width).  [Note: This assumes that one end of the distribution starts at zero.]  We can find a member Z of a class of exponentially decreasing functions such that we can use it as a threshold test.  The larger the first prize, the more spread out we can assume the prize distribution to be and the lower the value of Z that will serve as our threshold.</p>
<p>That's deep stuff, beyond my current mathematical abilities.</p>
<p>As to whether my solution would work better: yeah, I think it probably would, for most realistic prize offerings.  As would Sergei's, I imagine.

(All other versions require that the lesser prize be half the greater one.  I particularly like Raymond Smullyan's non-stochastic version.)  I hadn't run across this before.</p>
<p>I disavow having solved this in the manner you describe.  All my suggestions had to do with cultural constraints on the method of generating the prize amounts or their representations.  The solution you describe works to some extent for any generating distribution, and for fully random real numbers.</p>

If you throw horizontally a distance of 10 m and we assume that your arm is about one meter above the ground, then the time spent in the air can be calculated by saying $$\frac{1}{2}gt^2 = 1$$ This tells us that the ball spent about 0.45 seconds in the air. We also know that the initial velocity with which you threw the ball $%v_0$%, times $%t$% must be 10 meters. Since we now know $%t$%, we know that you must have thrown the ball at about $%v_0 = 22.4 m/s$%.</p>
<p>If you threw a ball upwards at that speed, we know that the velocity at the top is zero, and we know that $% v = v_0 + at$%. Setting $%v = 0$% and using our $%v_0$% of 22.4 and $%a=-10$%, we find that the ball spends 2.24 seconds going upwards. This will be our $%t$% in $%\Delta x = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$%. When we plug in everything we have, we find that $%\Delta x = 25$% meters.

"9007166"	""	"ph100 "	"100007518"	"<p>This seems like a flawed problem to me. If the monkey is swinging as the problem states, it is impossible for such a balance. The tension in the rope would actually be greater than the monkey's weight as the rope swings through the bottom (we didn't talk about this subject in this course, but it is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force"" rel=""nofollow"">centripetal force</a>) and less than the monkey's weight as it reaches one of the high points of its motion. </p>
<p>But, let's assume the swinging wasn't actually happening and the monkey is just suspended from this rope. In this case I agree with Narrina. Monkey and weight both accelerate upwards. This is a tricky question though. I was initially tempted to say that the weight goes up and the monkey goes down, but from an energy point of view that didn't make sense (for a few reasons, but the reason that came to my mind first was something called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum"" rel=""nofollow"">conservation of angular momentum</a>, which we unfortunately didn't cover in this class). </p>
<p>Once I felt like the monkey had to go up too, I was confused for a minute because it seemed like the monkey was somehow generating energy out of nothing. My <strong>wrong</strong> reasoning went as follows: As the monkey climbs up the rope, he does a certain amount of work. That work goes towards increasing his kinetic energy and offsetting the work done by gravity, thus giving the monkey potential energy, from the standpoint of the monkey, <em>he can't tell the difference between this situation and the situation of climbing a rope that was tied to a branch high in the tree</em>. But this leads to a problem. Because as the monkey gains PE and KE, SO DOES THE WEIGHT ON THE OTHER END! What's going on!? Where is this energy coming from?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out I made a mistake. The monkey CAN tell the difference between climbing this rope and climbing a rope that is tied to a branch, because <em>this rope is accelerating downwards!</em> This means that the monkey actually has to do twice as much work as he would have if the rope were tied off. This explains the ""extra"" energy in the other mass.

But I think that you have misunderstood what Adam meant by ""extremeness"". In the question video he says: ""how is extreme is our <strong>prediction</strong> of y compared to x"". He wants to know how much a single data point ""x"" deviates from the average when compared with its prediction ""y"", i.e., we are comparing their z scores. The standard deviation measures how much the data as a whole (being the average of squared differences $%(x-\mu)$%) deviates from the average. You can't use standard deviation to measure ""extremeness"" as it was defined. So, given that $%|r|&lt;0$%, $%|Z_{y}|$% will always be smaller than $%z_{x}$%, and therefore $%y$% will be always less extreme than $%x$% in this case. But you're correct that they could be equally extreme if $%|r| = 1$%. So a more precise statement (without the assumption that $%|r| &lt; 1$%) would be ""y is at most as extreme as x"". Although in practice, I think it's unlikely that you would find a perfect correlation between $%y$% and $%x$%. Good point though, I'll make the statement more clear, by adding the constraint $%|r|&lt;1$%. Thank you again. :)</p>"	"comment"	"10010319"	"10010146"	"2012-08-05 08:05:16.262988+00"	"1"	""	"10118559"	"100012003"	"2012-08-05 08:06:18.41372+00"	"10014648"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>Thank you for your thoughtful reply.  You are definitely correct that the problem is in the English language, not in the mathematics.  In English, you ""ignore"" a person by not paying any attention to what they are saying.  This is not what you are doing when you omit outliers.  Instead, you are paying very close attention to them, and then making a decision to not include this data point in your analysis.  So, you are not ""ignoring"" what the data is telling you.  In fact, if you ""ignored"" the data, that would mean you are not paying attention to it, which means that you would never find any outliers! </p>
<p>With regards to the theoretical, mathematical approach to the course, while the ""hands on"" format is great, there are many intuitive gaps that are not covered properly.  For example, z scores is one of the most important concepts in statistics as it allows you to compare vastly different distributions and determine the relative position of specific data points from each distribution.  This concept should be emphasized much more at the expense of other, more abstruse and less useful concepts.</p>
<p>My point being that an experienced statistics professor should have been used to design and teach this course.  I think that the physics course is better for that reason than this course is. </p>

If you already pretty much know what you're looking for, the lines really let you see how after a change in time, <code>dt</code>, every possible state has evolved in the way it would have if the object really were in that state. That is, every point <code>(x,v)</code> in this state-space moves to the point <code>(x+v*dt, v)</code>.</p>
<p>The thing that is confusing about the grid lines, though, is that in the update frame, the numbers on the position axis still represent the position that the state would have been in at a time <code>dt</code> ago. The position of where it is now would still be given by the grid lines as drawn in rest of the frames. Perhaps it would be useful to indicate this distinction somehow. You could draw either the new or (as I would probably prefer) the old axes lines and numbers in a different color, and then give an indication in the legend that the slanted lines represent the old position of the states that they intersect. And then show that the time has advanced.</p>
<p>Also, it's possible that the confusion is made worse by the inclusion of negative velocities on the plot. The result of doing this is that the axes numbers are moving in the negative position direction, while almost all of the region corresponding to the states we are interested in is moving in the positive position direction. (Although I guess there is some value in including zero velocity states, since those are the fixed points. And if you stopped at 0, then it would be harder to add the distinction in times I was looking talking about before.)</p>
<p>Finally, and related to the first point, it would probably be nice to have some labels on both of the axes. That's just the middle-school math teacher coming out in me.</p>

<p>There´s a detail that would be interesting to study with a little more detail and that as to do with the turning instant. When does the period change from decreasing to increasing? That instant is not (for sure) the instant water has drained all out because the center of gravity does not change instantaneously from the down position to the up position! The reason is because the lesser the water inside the sphere, the lesser it will contribute to the center of gravity of the hollow sphere plus water. In resume, the center of gravity will go down as the water falls down but there will be an instant, during this fall and before water as all drain out, where the center of gravity will star to go up again. </p>

<p>two quick, silly questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the progress page we can view homework scores. We can also go back and redo the homework still. Obviously we should go back and review our errors but should we also change the answer? Will changing it change the % correct in progress?</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Office Hours tab in progress has it marked as 0% complete and 0% correct. I watched the office hours. Should we worry about that %? Will this even remain on the progress tab?<br>

The last time i had to do homework was 15 years back. Learning was not always fun in my live but the older i get the more I look enviously at the things the students can learn today. So i decide to enroll to cs101 at udacity. I thought that's might be fun. i grow up with computers and the money i earned at my first job at thirteen was completly invested into computers. so a the beginning of cs101 it was a little bit boring for me but from unit 3 it was getting more and more exciting. My personal schedule only allowed me to do homework at the weekend. I always submit my homework short bevor closing. And then with unit 6 everything moves out of lane. My first look at unit 6 was possible on saturday. I really never had to do with recrusiv programming. I had to make the experience recrusiv programming is a totaly different kind of thinking. Usually my thoughts are straight therefor recrusiv thinking at the beginning was like mental weightlifting. Tuesday was approaching and my homework was not ready. The straw that broke the camel's back came as unit 7 and the final exam was released before Tueseday and the deadline for the final exam was set to sunday. My homework was not finished, the new unit was out and the deadline for the finale exam was earlier than expected. In my head i could listen to the queen song ""under pressure"". Dave, you always draw smiling faces. You say learning should be fun. At this time for me David Evans became to David the Evil Udacitiator Evans. At Wednesday 01:00 pm (gmt +1) i finished all homeworks from unit 6 exept the last starred and submited it. I was proud to solve the recrusiv parts and yes, i danced in my homeoffice because I was happy, who cares about quicksort. At wednesday afterwork i watched the videos of the last unit and start to solve the questions for the final exam. In compare with homework 6 the unstarred questions was scary easy and i've the feeling to have overlook something, hmm?. Thursday i look at the starred exam question and the nightshift began. Strictly speaking there was two nightshifts thursday and friday necessary to solve the last head nuts and i learned a lot about levenshtein. And finally at saturday 02:00am i finished all questions, delete all debug print statments an submit it. Now after a short sleep (have i mention my two cute little girls like to wake up early?) im sitting in the bathtube, the sun is shinning, David the Evil Udacitiator Evans is back David Evans and i feel blue. I don't agree that David needs a haircut but his shirts could be one size smaller ;-). </p>
<p>Thank you David for kicking my brain, thank you Peter for showing how easy it could be.</p>
<p>I will curse mymself but I've just enrolled for three courses in april</p>

<p>Here is a hint to get you closer to your objective.  Your path comparison is wrong at the bottom of your program.  It should be:</p>
<pre><code>    for char2 in weighted:
        if len(unweighted[char2]) != len(weighted[char2]):
</code></pre>
<p>See?  You are supposed to check the <strong>length</strong> of the shortest unweighted path against the <strong>length</strong> of the shortest path of least weight.  If you change this line, you will see that you are closer to the correct answer.  I haven't gone further on your code than this.  But it's possible that you might sometimes be missing returning the shortest length path in the case where two weighted paths have the same cost.  See the example in my original posting above, where there are two paths of the same weight, but one is shorter than the other... you need to use this shorter path of equal weight for the weighted value.  Hope that sort of makes sense.</p>"	"comment"	"11004418"	"11004136"	"2012-08-03 22:53:33.623649+00"	"1"	""	"\N"	"100011294"	"2012-08-03 22:53:33.623649+00"	"11006602"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

It is not rocket science ......ok so maybe this is rocket science at a manageable level and it represents something that is so scarry to most people.  That is probably the best thing that you have done is that you take something that is unapproachable to most and have made it accessible. Physics is something that to me with Chemistry and Calculus represents the most difficult subjects in high school.  If you can make it accessible to the many then you have done a great thing.  This is like Blues Clues for adults........it is disarming.......it is not fearful and it is enjoyable.  Your approach makes it that way.  Khan gave the address at MIT and he said that his approach was to make the un accessible accessible.  You dont need a lot of money to get an education to learn.  You have done the same thing with the topic of physics. One of the greatest things that I ever saw was one of the directors of a state soccer organization teaching adults how to teach kids to play soccer.  He acted like he really was our coach and we really were six.  Initially I was like surely he is not going to ask us to kick the ball around and then sit on it like we were a chicken waiting or our egg to hatch but he did.  The wisdom was that in making it like a game and being disarming then the atmosphere was more conducive to learning because it was non threatening.  It was a game.......but your approach is very important and it might not be like the Dutch man from MIT but it enables more people to  learn the material.  I wrote all this........it kept on going but I wanted to say I appreciate your approach and I value this experience. Thank you.

<p>Would you be so kind as to compile some resource for premade functions that will likely be used in homeworks/tests so that we can get a feel for what they do and how they operate before we need to use them?</p>
<p>In Dave's 101, and so far (all of chapter 1 coursework, not homework) in Wes' 262, I felt that I was introduced to the functions before they were just magically part of a one line solution.  Perhaps our instructor is expecting that more functions or ways to use them were introduced in 101 than actually were.  Some examples were set, count, max using a key in one and another after that exposure with lambda, list(reversed(, for and ifs used inside returns.  It's not so much that I mind them being used - I'm happy to be exposed to things I don't know, that's why I'm taking the classes.  It's that I don't see them being used before the solution is given makes me worry about the final, that we will be expected to know something we've never been exposed to before.  Even if it's just ""look over the random import and see if there is something there that might be useful.  At least we're given a pointer telling us where to even begin looking.</p>
<p>Also, I very much enjoyed Andy's corner. I almost felt as if I should have watched that first.  In future chapters, I will try that.  However, in list comprehension #4, at the end of the assignment video, you say ""your variable, ta_300, should look exactly like this."" And I made my results look exactly like you requested, and got marked wrong, and after I watched the solution video, saw that you had added ""the"" where you originally had ""is TA for"".  So I changed the concatenated text to match your solution and it was then marked correct.  Being marked wrong for doing what you originally ask does not bother me, but it does earn one /poke. :)</p>"	"answer"	"5000002"	"5000002"	"2012-04-17 12:20:31.402634+00"	"6"	""	"\N"	"100007518"	"2012-04-18 02:16:39.718638+00"	"5000234"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

"1032877"	""	"cs373 "	"100010722"	"<p>Hi. I had a similar set-up as yours (I also own a Mindstorm set) with one ultrasonic sensor rotating on a shaft. I wrote a program in MATLAB to have the sensor rotate 360 degrees forwards and backwards (so not to entangle the cables) and read (about each 10 degrees) the eight echoes that the ultrasonic sensor is capable of registering. I then display this a ""radar like"" graph that polar plots the angle and the points representing these echoes.</p>
<p>The program works and it displays what the robot ""sees"" with the ultrasonic sensor, but this first incursion into sonar reveals some things that are to be solved if one pretends to use these measurements for localization or mapping, or both.</p>
<p>It turns out that while you do get distances to obstacles, the resolution is very low. I suspect this to be due to a wide main lobe in the ultrasonic sensor, so you get echoes that come not only from straight ahead but also from the sides. This is unlike laser rangefinders where you do get a very good reading of distance and direction. </p>
<p>Now, as I see it (and I hope to be modeling and experimenting with this soon) the first step is to empirically determine the characteristics of the sensor; mainly its radiation and sensitivity pattern (both in the vertical and horizontal planes) and possibly detection probabilities according to the type of surface on which the sound bounces back.</p>
<p>After this one could model and test different geometries to predict what sort of sonar response they will give rise to.</p>
<p>When this works one could try localization before mapping (easier problems first!) with a map that describes not only the environment but, for example, texture of the objects (to associate with detection probabilities).</p>
<p>A particle filter would calculate, for each particle, the expected sonar return and calculate the agreement with the actual measurement (the equivalent of the sense and measurement functions) to set the probability of survival of the said particle.</p>
<p>As I see it, it will be a lot of work and that's why I'm using MATLAB and the RWTH Toolbox for Mindstorms. I've been connecting to the Brick with Bluetooth and USB, the latter seems to be a lot more stable but it limits the autonomy of the robot to the cable length. Later Bluetooth will extend the range and finally perhaps the program could be translated to NXC to actually have it run in the brick.</p>
<p>Another option (which also requires work) is to design a better ultrasonic sensor using phased arrays and interface using I2C with the brick. This is much more than I can explain here, but I'll say a microchip PIC has I2C so it's doable (I've built an intelligent claw that is controlled by a servo which is controlled by a PIC that communicates with the Brick, basically to show how the sensors and outputs of the brick can be extended).</p>
<p>Well, those are some ideas I hope to have time to work on. What's your plan?</p>"	"answer"	"1032831"	"1032831"	"2012-04-07 15:50:27.39009+00"	"3"	""	"\N"	"100010933"	"2012-04-07 16:53:13.532181+00"	"1044592"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

With the advent of electricity there is no longer a need to keep the windmills operating but many still turn and work, you can just hook up an electric pump which is more reliable.  There is this one place called Kinderdijk that was lots of windmills in a concentrated area.  I am assuming that there was a lot of water that needed to be raised........you needed a lot of work so you had to have lots of windmills. Just like if you have a heavy load you need lots of horses to pull the wagon.  In any case it is a wonderful site because we do not have them here.  Holland is a wonderful country and very beautiful especially during tulip season and the people are wonderful.  It really was simple but sometimes the windmills failed and had floods but the people learned and that is why they are such great engineers.  </p>

"9003001"	""	"ph100 "	"100030529"	"<p>Based on what Andy suggested, I found equations for d1 and d2.</p>
<p>d1 = 6t + 6. The runner is running as a constant speed (6 m/s), and when t = 0, he is already at 6 m (based on the graph).</p>
<p>d2 is more complicated. Since the bicyclist is accelerating, but hits a constant speed after 4 seconds, d2 has to be a piece-wise function, meaning there are different equations for different times. The first equation, which describes the bicyclist as he's accelerating, is for 0 ≤ t &lt; 4 seconds. The second equation, for when the bicyclist is going at a constant speed, is for t ≥ 4 seconds. (The equal to signs are not fixed, AKA the the time ranges could be 0 ≤ t ≤ 4 seconds and t &gt; 4 seconds.)</p>
<p>Solving the first equation is tricky, since the bicyclist is changing speeds every second. Because the lack of a constant speed, I chose to model the first equation after a quadratic equation, y = at^2 + bt + c. In this equation, y is the distance the bicyclist has gone, and t is the time. So the goal is solve for a, b, and c, which are constants.</p>
<p>We can do this by seeing how far the bicyclist has gone after t seconds. You know that the bicyclist starts at 0 meters and accelerates 3 m/s. So after 1 second, he's gone 3 meters, then after 2 seconds, his speed is now 6 m/s, and he's gone 9 meters. You can continue this out for 4 seconds. <a href=""http://imgur.com/SuBAy"" rel=""nofollow"">This is a table of time (in seconds) and the distance (in meters) the bicyclist, b, has gone after 4 seconds.</a> Using this table, you can substitute and solve for a, b, and c. You will need three equations. Luckily, the table above provides enough points to solve. After some algebra, you will find that c = 0, b = 1.5, and a = 1.5. The the equation for the cyclist from time 0 to 4 seconds is y = 1.5t^2 + 1.5t.</p>
<p>The second equation is easy to solve. After 4 seconds, the bicyclist has a constant speed of 12 m/s. You know that after 4 seconds, the bicyclist has gone 30 meters. So the equation becomes y = 12t - 18.</p>
<p>The final, piece-wise equation for the distance the bicyclist traveled looks like <a href=""http://imgur.com/OJtmZ"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>. </p>
<p>Now, as Andy said, set d1 and d2 equal to each other and solve for t. You'll find that whichever equation of d2 you use, you will find that it equals d1 at t = 4 seconds.</p>"	"answer"	"9002489"	"9002489"	"2012-07-04 21:15:04.435487+00"	"0"	""	"9025003"	"100007518"	"2012-07-04 21:21:28.135564+00"	"9003770"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>NASA has a system that constructs optimal algorithms for the Mars rovers and other limited-capability systems.  It optimizes things like square roots, sines, and signal transforms for specific needs and data characteristics, including the number of bits of accuracy required.  And proves the algorithm correct, for the target architecture.  That code then runs in an environment that considers rover time constraints, power limits, and priorities -- also proven correct, as nearly as current technology allows.  And this is in service to goals uploaded from Earth -- goals that are themselves developed within an optimal planning framework.</p>
<p>Here's another example: the <a href=""http://www.kurzweilai.net/graphics-software-gets-faster-and-easier-to-write"" rel=""nofollow"">Halide</a> image processing program compiler for parallel hardware.  Compared to hand-optimized code,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Halide versions were typically about one-third as long but offered<br>
significant performance gains — two-, three-, or even six-fold<br>
speedups. In one instance, the Halide program was actually longer than<br>
the original — but the speedup was 70-fold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And after taking Steve Hoffman's CS253 to build my own blog or wiki, I learned that one can create either application -- and much more -- with just a few parameter settings in <a href=""http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/series?name=v7kABKL6R"" rel=""nofollow"">Django</a>.

Wouldn't $% a = \frac{g\sin{\alpha}}{1+I/mr^{2}} $% ? where I is the moment of inertia. (assuming it is some sort of a spherical/cylindrical body that rolls (without slipping). So, the value of 'g' obtained would be off by a factor of $% 1 + I/mr^{2} $% which can be off by quite a large amount.</p>"	"answer"	"9002741"	"9002741"	"2012-07-03 18:05:28.722055+00"	"1"	"(accepted)"	"\N"	"100007518"	"2012-07-03 18:45:34.514255+00"	"9003441"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"t"

Michael defines it in the lecture as <i>""given graph G, [...] l and two nodes u and v, is there are a simple path from u to v consisting of l or mode nodes""</i>. Again, <b><i>""l or more nodes""</i></b>. For example, if there is a simple path consisting of exactly two nodes, then by definition, decision problem for any l&lt;=2 shall return TRUE. The only thing that is missing from this definition in my view is a restriction on the domain of possible l values, i.e. can l be a 1, 0 or a negative number? If you look at <code>long_and_simple_decision</code> implementation in the test harness you will find that it returns FALSE for l = 0.

<p>@Goldsong - I do agree that, in the absence of the ""Udacity"" name itself currently meaning anything, the weight of the instructors' names is perhaps the only indication of the approximate quality of a course. However, as has been discussed previously on this forum (and a distinction made clear by Udacity itself), there is a big difference between ""A course taught by a professor at Stanford"" -vs- ""A course taught at Stanford"". </p>

Although your suggested phrasing is completely factually accurate, by including the ""Stanford""/""Google"" name in the same line as the name of the course, it appears to give Udacity courses some authority that they do not have. If an employer considers that to be misleading, expect your application to be thrown out very quickly!</p>
<p>What I firmly hope is that, over time, a body of Udacity ""graduates"" will go on to achieve great things on their own merit and the reputation of the Udacity institution will rise in its own right, negating the need to hang on the (stellar) reputation of its lecturers alone.</p>"	"comment"	"10010207"	"10010057"	"2012-08-03 11:21:50.373662+00"	"0"	""	"\N"	"100006690"	"2012-08-03 11:21:50.373662+00"	"10014495"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

If this post violates any of the forum policies, please let me know, and I will promptly close/delete it. </p>
<p>Some of my suggestions have already been mentioned by others (see <a href=""http://www.udacity-forums.com/cs101/questions/75/suggestions-for-the-course"" rel=""nofollow"">Suggestions for the Course</a>).</p>
<hr>
<h1>Homework Handling</h1>
<h2>1. Instant incorrect/correct flagging.</h2>
<p>It would be beneficial to allow a student to know whether or not their solution is correct upon submission. To mitigate such this method, allow for a series of retries, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only 1 try on multiple choice questions (2 tries if there is more than 1 correct answer)</li>
<li>2-3 tries on free response and programming questions</li>
</ul>
<p>Solutions should still only be posted after the deadline has passed. There are some pros and cons to this suggestion:</p>
<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More students can confidently advise other students</li>
<li>Everyone makes mistakes; this method would allow students to re-think their (incorrect) solutions, while supplying some more guided discussion on particularly troublesome problems</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>People are able to make multiple accounts to 'try/guess' questions, submitting only the correct solutions on their main accounts</li>
<li>Ultimately, it is up to an individual's moral integrity, on whether or not to exploit this possibility of retries with multiple accounts</li>
<li>The possibility of more temptation, for students to discuss (the correct) solutions before the deadline</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Supply a 'black box' function/procedure for programming assignments</h2>
<p>To clarify, let me use the max depth question from HW 3:</p>
<p>The 'black box' function (the function's internal code is not shown) supplied would work exactly as how the student's final crawl_web function is expected work for the HW problem (i.e. print out all the URLs up to the inputted depth value). This will allow students to test out certain behavioral aspects of the function. This would also limit the number of questions (and doubts) regarding 'corner cases/undefined behavior' in the HW. </p>
<hr>
<h1>Grading</h1>
<h2>1. Different grading weight for starred and non-starred questions.</h2>
<p>This suggestion has already been discussed, but I would like to offer some proposals as to what to do with starred and non-starred questions. One option, would be to only have all non-starred questions be counted as HW grades. Starred questions can be counted as extra credit, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make up credit for having an incorrect non-starred question</li>
<li>For each starred question answered correctly, give a 0.5-1% extra credit on the student's final grade</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Partial credit on HW problems.</h2>
<p>This is how I imagine programming problems are currently being graded (please correct me if I am wrong): For each submission, the student's program/code is 'included' into a test file, which has a procedure with individual test cases. This procedure consists of various 'if' statements, which check the result/output of the student's code (against various inputs, in certain cases), and reports whether the results match what is expected (i.e. returns TRUE or FALSE). If any such test case fails, the HW problem is marked as incorrect.</p>
<p>Thus, one method to supply partial credit, is to have each individual test case be a 'partial' point. If a student's code passes 5/6 test cases, then the credit awarded would be ((5/6) * (total point value of question)). The same general principle can be applied to multiple choice questions which have more than one correct answer.</p>
<hr>
<p>These suggestions are by no means perfect, and are my personal opinions. Please let me know if any clarification is needed on any of the topics detailed above. I would enjoy hearing other student's personal suggestions and opinion on the matter. Likewise, please feel free to supply any criticism on my suggestions.</p>
<p>This post is not meant to demean the HW logistics of CS101/Udacity as it is now. I apologize if my post comes off as such. I truly appreciate what Udacity is trying to accomplish, by offering top-notch classes to the masses. I hope that they continue to do so.</p>"	"question"	"\N"	"\N"	"2012-03-17 21:07:03.964805+00"	"2"	""	"131759"	"100007540"	"2012-03-24 15:06:54.287521+00"	"54056"	"\N"	"\N"	"378"	"f"

<p>w.r.t. naming the instructor, Alastair's point is well taken.  However, unfortunatelly, if Udacity is just in the process of building its reputation and thus it is not known in, say, a university in Bangladesh, mentioning Udacity in the CV is not effective if you are applying to such university.  Once Udacity gets a reputation of its own, mentioning the instructor is irrelevant but in the meantime, I do not think so.  Still, I can certainly see the point.</p>
<p>On the other hand, personally I think that having had Sebastian or Peter as instructors is more important than having taken the specific class.  These are people that are so prominent in their respective fields, so experienced, that they would have full classes in any university regardless of the class they teach.  Many people taking this class are not aware that Sebastian consistently had packed standing-only talks at international conferences long before he joined Stanford.  In other words, I would take any class in any online organization (Udacity, EdX, Coursera) taught by either of them and it is to my great sorrow that I did not learn about their original AI class until after it was over.  Not all teachers in Udacity are Thrun or Norvig, though, but just mentioning the affiliation of the instructor with a reputable university gives credence to the online class.</p>
<p>The way I see it, if you had the opportunity to take a kinesiology class with Michael Jordan while you were still in high-school would you care what specific class it was?  Would you omit from the cv that you had Michael Jordan as an instructor?  Well.. it might be the case that I am just a big fan of Michael but I do not think so.</p>"	"comment"	"10010207"	"10010057"	"2012-08-03 08:31:25.160938+00"	"1"	""	"10117368"	"100008281"	"2012-08-03 08:32:38.927981+00"	"10014483"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>Here is an example to make it clean (i played around in the GUI to make a clear example)</p>
<p>m = (1,4) # its a tuple</p>
<p>def g(x,y):<br>
   print x+y</p>
<p>def l(x):<br>
   if x==(1,4):<br>
      return 1<br>
   else:<br>
      return 0</p>
<p>1) Now if you try g(m) you will get an error saying it wants 2 parameters and not 1.</p>
<p>2) If you put g(*m) , it will unzip the m tuple and it will give you the correct 1+4 = 5 result</p>
<p>3) Now if you try l(*m) it will tell you that you gave it 2 arguments</p>
<p>4) Try l(m) and you will see that m is passed as a tuple.</p>
<p>I guess (pretty sure) that *m is very good to create a big tuple of parameters and then pass it to a function </p>
<p>Hope it helps</p>"	"answer"	"5004542"	"5004542"	"2012-04-25 16:27:13.460037+00"	"0"	""	"\N"	"100007518"	"2012-04-26 16:14:26.236221+00"	"5006799"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

"1011963"	""	"cs373 "	"100010343"	"<p>I'll try to expand on @absherwin's (completely correct) answer.</p>
<p>You're misunderstanding how a probability density works. Let's consider a really really simple probability density, the uniform density, for a random number uniformly distributed from 0 to 1. </p>
<p>f(x) = 1: 0&lt;x&lt;1<br>
f(x) = 0: otherwise</p>
<p>Now, what's f(.36)? It's 1. Oops. I'm quite sure that the probability of getting .36 when I ask for a random number between 0 and 1 is not 1. In fact, if our function really returned any possible number between 0 and 1, the probability of getting .36 would be zero. Not approximately zero, but zero.  If you have a probability density function, you can't use it to predict point values, because the point value is zero. (Unless it's the Dirac delta function. Shhh, @absherwin.)</p>
<p>Very obviously, if you integrate that function above from -infinity to infinity it's 1. (If you forget how to integrate, just figure out the area: 1 high times 1 wide is 1.) The way to get probabilities out of a density function is to integrate over an interval: you never can ask about the probability of a single value-- which would always be zero, because the integral of f(x) from a to a is always zero for any f(x)-- but only the probability of an interval. </p>
<p>For the uniform density function f(x), if we want to know the probability that the random number is between .25 and .75, we integrate from .25 to .75 and, fortunately, discover we get the correct answer of .5. For your gaussian, you could ask the probability that x is between .8 and .9, for example, and discover, if Wolfram Alpha isn't lying to me, that it's about .028.</p>
<p>So, your method of approximation for the guassian total probability won't work. You have to integrate, and when you do (I recommend Wolfram Alpha) you'll discover that the integral of the gaussian from -infinity to infinity is 1. The integral of every probability density function from -infinity to infinity is 1.</p>"	"answer"	"1011810"	"1011810"	"2012-03-04 17:10:18.084081+00"	"3"	"(accepted)"	"1046823"	"100010343"	"2012-03-04 17:37:04.089021+00"	"1016433"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"t"

The additional point is that in many cases there are multiple paths between two nodes that have the same minimum weight.  In this case, the length you need to use is the shortest length of the equal minimum weight paths.  (For some people, this just falls out in the way they wrote their algorithms.  For others, you need to add a couple of checks to make sure you do this.)</p>
<p>So I would suggest one more line:</p>
<p>C -&gt; min(len(min_weight_paths)) == len(hop_path)</p>

Dist_so_far becomes a standard Python list that heapq then manages.<br>
Heapq eliminates the need for a lot of the code that's in the question.  There's no need for a separate shortest_dist_node method: just use heapq.heappop().  Add a new entry with heapq.heappush(new entry).  Heapq is so efficient there's no need to delete entries related to nodes, or to update them for lower distances (updating is difficult or impossible anyway since heapq doesn't keep track of where old entries are); just add new entries for the same nodes with lower distance values and they will end up higher in the heap.<br>
With heapq, the entire answer becomes ten lines of code or less, including the import heapq statement.  The only issue is the structure of the entries to use in the dist_so_far array.<br>
Heapq provides a simpler answer than the question appears to intend, but custom heap code in native Python seems to run too slow for the tests based on larger examples.</p>"	"comment"	"11004091"	"11004064"	"2012-08-03 00:30:15.22149+00"	"0"	""	"11036412"	"100068905"	"2012-08-03 00:30:35.417065+00"	"11006493"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>I think we have now established that the marking robot doesn't look at the code you've written. It simply submits inputs to your program and checks if it produces the correct results. It also completely ignores any comments you put in the program to help you understand later what was going on at the time you wrote the program.</p>
<p>Watching the forum some questions cropped up over and over and I admit to being confused about what was required.</p>

I spent a fair amount of time writing code that did this, only to find it ran too slowly to meet all the tests, and much slower than much simpler code based on heapq which ignores all bookkeeping other than preventing 'locked-down' values in final_dict from being subsequently overwritten.  Indeed, keeping track of the location of an entry in a heap managed by heapq appears impossible without losing the speed advantage heapq offers.<br>
It thus seems, unfortunately, like the hint may have been a red herring, since only heapq-based code seems fast enough to meet all the tests.<br>

<p>No, the HTML and JavaScript parsers will not be fully featured by any sense of the word. Building and maintaining a browser like Firefox costs 100s of millions of dollars a year (we can thank Google for footing the bill). To do CSS you are going to need another set of lexers, parsers, and interpreters and the additional internal structure for the DOM. From the perspective of teaching about programming languages, we don't gain anything from going over CSS and the DOM and we certainly don't have the time to implement the components necessary.</p>
<p>That's definitely possible. We're just showing how you would go about doing optimizations. Arithmetic identities are simple to understand and the ""optimizations"" are straightforward. </p>
<p>In the real world, it's often the true that an optimization that you put in your code could slow the execution time in certain cases. Sometimes we choose to do an optimization that speeds up the common-case and sacrifice the performance of the rare case. Modern CPU architectures are designed around the principle of making the common-case as fast as possible.

#
# Format: Submit via the Interpreter
#
# Consider the strings ""Tapachula"" and ""Temapache"", both of which name
# towns in the country of Mexico. They share a number of substrings in
# common. For exmaple, ""T"" and ""pa"" can be found in both. The longest
# common unbroken substring that they both share is ""apach"" -- it starts
# at position 1 in ""Tapachula"" and at position 3 in ""Temapache"". Note that
# ""Tapach"" is not a substring common to both: even though ""Temapache""
# contains both ""T"" and ""apach"", it does not contain the unbroken substring
# ""Tapach"". 
#
# Finding the longest common substring of two strings is an important
# problem in computer science. It is a building block to related problems,
# such as ""sequence alignment"" or ""greatest common subsequence"" that are
# used in problem domains as diverse as bioinformatics and making spelling
# checkers. 
#
# We will use memoization, recursion and list comprehensions to tackle this
# problem. In particular, we will build up a chart that stores computed
# partial answers. 
#
# To make the problem a bit easier, we'll start by computing the longest
# common *suffix* of two strings. For example, ""Tapachula"" and ""Temapache""
# have no common suffix -- or a common suffix of length 0, if you prefer.
# By contrast, ""Tapach"" and ""Temapach"" have a longest common suffix of
# length 5 (""apach""). One way to reason to that is that their last letters
# match (an ""h"" in both cases) -- and if you peel those last letters off
# the smaller problem of ""Temapac"" vs. ""Tapac"" has a common suffix of size
# four. 
#
# Write a memoized procedure csuffix(X,Y) that returns the size of the
# longest common suffix of two strings X and Y. This is 0 if X and Y have
# different final letters. Otherwise, it is 1 plus csuffix() of X and Y,
# each with that common last letter removed. Use a global dictionary chart
# that maps (X,Y) pairs to their longest common suffix values to avoid
# recomputing work. If either X or Y is the empty string, csuffix(X,Y) must
# return 0. 
#
# Once we have csuffix(), we can find the largest common substring of X and
# Y by computing the csuffix() of all possible combinations of *prefixes*
# of X and Y and returning the best one. Write a procedure prefixes(X) that
# returns a list of all non-empty strings that are prefixes of X. For
# example, prefixes(""cat"") == [ ""c"", ""ca"", ""cat"" ]. 
#
# Finally, write a procedure lsubstring(X,Y) that returns the length of the
# longest common substring of X and Y by considering all prefixes x of X
# and all prefixes y of Y and returning the biggest csuffix(x,y)
# encountered.

# Hint 1. Reminder: ""hello""[-1:] == ""o""
#
# Hint 2. Reminder: ""goodbye""[:-1] == ""goodby"" 
#
# Hint 3. suffices(X) can be written in one line with list comprehensions.
# Consider ""for i in range(len(X))"".

As it is obvious from carefully reading Karp's paper what he calls a ""chromatic number problem"" is generally known as a ""k-coloring problem"", i.e. problem of verifying that graph can be colored with k colors. On the other hand, WolframAlfa article states (unambiguously this time) that chromatic number problem is NP-complete and references Skiena's text:  </p>
<blockquote>

that the chromatic polynomial $%\pi_{G}(z)&gt;0$%. Calculating the chromatic number of a graph is <br>
an NP-complete problem (Skiena 1990, pp. 211-212). </p>

<p>If nothing else, this one is relatively easy to solve by bruteforce using few lines of Python code. The ""bruteforceless"" solution is relatively easy as well.</p>
<p>Let's take it from the end:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want <code>p[2]</code> to be <code>3</code>. At the time of setting <code>p[2]</code>, both <code>p[0]</code> and <code>p[1]</code> should have their final correct values, i.e. <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>, respectively. Thus, this one will resolve itself if we got right the rest.</li>
<li>Next one is <code>p[1]</code>, which should be set to <code>2</code>. At the time, when it is assigned its final value, <code>p[0]</code> should be final as well and thus we can be sure, it will equal <code>1</code>. Calculating initial value of <code>p[2]</code> is then as easy as <code>p[2] = 2 - 1</code>, which is <code>1</code>.</li>
<li>The last one is <code>p[0]</code>, which should be set to <code>1</code>. Its value will be calculated as its original value plus value of <code>p[1]</code>. This means that <code>p[0]</code> and <code>p[1]</code> should be initially set to any two values, which add up to <code>1</code>. Therefore, there is infinite number of solutions, e.g. <code>0</code>,<code>1</code> or <code>1</code>,<code>0</code> or <code>-1</code>,<code>2</code> etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chosen solution might be checked with this simple code (copy-pasted from the homework assignment):</p>
<pre><code>p = [0,1,1]

p[0] = p[0] + p[1]
p[1] = p[0] + p[2]
p[2] = p[0] + p[1]

print p # =&gt; [1,2,3]

<p><strong>HW3.2 Mutating Lists</strong></p>
<p><em>Procedure #1:</em></p>
<pre><code>def proc1(p):
  p[0] = p[1]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>As explained in <em>Unit3.13 Replace Spy</em>, this procedure will clearly modify its argument. In case it is not clear to you, look again at videos 7 to 13 in Unit 3.</p>
<p>It should be noted, that this function will not even work with lists of less than 2 elements. However, this fact has nothing to do with the question being asked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Procedure #2:</em></p>
<pre><code>def proc2(p):
  p = p + [1]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>This one does not modify the original argument. That is because the <code>+</code> operator creates <strong>new instance</strong> of list object and makes <code>p</code> to refer to that new instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Procedure #3:</em></p>
<pre><code>def proc3(p):
  q = p
  p.append(3)
  q.pop()
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>This will indeed modify the argument, but it will also undo all the changes done. When you look closer at it, you will find out that <code>q</code> and <code>p</code> are referencing <strong>the same</strong> instance of list object, thus the element (integer <code>3</code>) appended using <code>p</code> ""alias"", will be popped-out using <code>q</code> ""alias"", which will leave the original list in the exactly the same state as it was in the beginning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Procedure #4:</em></p>
<p>def proc4(p):<br>
    q = []<br>
    while p:<br>
      q.append(p.pop())<br>
    while q:<br>
      p.append(q.pop())</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This one is the most interesting of all four. It will gradually pop-out all elements from <code>p</code> and append them to the different list, referenced by <code>q</code>. The <code>q</code>-list will contain all elements from <code>p</code>, just in the opposite order and <code>p</code> will be left empty. Then, whole process is repeated again in the opposite direction: elements are gradually popped-out from <code>q</code> and appended to <code>p</code>, leaving <code>q</code> empty again and <code>p</code> with all elements from <code>q</code>, just in the opposite order. Lot's of work done, big pile of bricks moved from one heap (LIFO stack in fact) to another and then back, but the result is exactly the same as if nothing was done at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can test it by running the code below:</p>
<pre><code>def proc1(p):
  p[0] = p[1]

def proc2(p):
  p = p + [1]

def proc3(p):
  q = p
  p.append(3)

<p><strong>HW3.3 Product List:</strong></p>
<p>This is the first assignment from series with subtitle ""Setting initial value correctly"" (HW3.3, HW3.4 and HW3.5). It is also about <code>for</code>-loop, but it can be solved also using <code>while</code>-loop from Unit2 (and I think that if one grasps concept of <code>while</code>-loop, then <code>for</code>-loop is about the same, just with slightly different syntax and actually easier).</p>
<p>Regarding the initial value, there was very nice answer from @larry96 in <a href=""http://www.udacity-forums.com/cs101/questions/23274/homework-33-specification/23299"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> thread. This information just needs to be written down:</p>
<pre><code>#Define a procedure, product_list,
#takes as input a list of numbers,
#and returns a number that is
#the result of multiplying all
#those numbers together.

#product_list([9]) =&gt; 9
#product_list([1,2,3,4]) =&gt; 24

def product_list(p):

  # set the initial value to 1 - not 0, not anything else (see fnenu's post)
  product = 1

  # go through all values in the list and sequentialy multiply them
  for val in p:
    product = product * val

  # finally return the computed value
  return product
</code></pre>
<p>The equivalent solution using <code>while</code> instead of <code>for</code> would look as ugly as this (that is why we have <code>for</code>-loops):</p>

<p>This assignment is yet another example of noticing how are you doing it manually as I mentioned in <a href=""http://www.udacity-forums.com/cs101/questions/24872/homework2-correct-solutions"" rel=""nofollow"">HW2 post</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You note down the product you have at the beginning (i.e. <code>1</code>).</li>
<li>Then you go through all elements of the list, one by one</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>And for each of them, you overwrite your noted product by new number computed as <code>&lt;noted-down value&gt; * &lt;element value&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>At the end, you have the final result written in your note</li>

<p><strong>HW3.4 Greatest:</strong></p>
<p>The second one from ""Setting initial value correctly"" series. It reminds me of very simillar example in <a href=""http://www.udacity-forums.com/cs101/questions/22952/need-book-about-algorithms-and-logic"" rel=""nofollow"">Stroustrup's book</a>, where he is computing minimum temperature measured at some place during one month and mistakenly sets the initial maximum value to zero. And then winter month, with all temperatures below zero comes... (Disclaimer: The example was not exactly this one, but I have borrowed my copy of that book to one of my friends and I do not remember it exactly - message is the same, however.)</p>
<pre><code>#Define a procedure, greatest,
#that takes as input a list
#of positive numbers, and
#returns the greatest number
#in that list. If the input
#list is empty, the output
#should be 0.

#greatest([4,23,1]) =&gt; 23
#greatest([]) =&gt; 0

def greatest(p):

  # at first check for empty list
  if not p:
    return 0

  # this is the best initial value I can think of,
  # however 0 would do as well in this assignment,
  # because ""takes as input a list of POSITIVE numbers""
  max = p[0]

  # go through all the values in the list
  for val in p:

    # and if some of them is higher than any of them before
    if max &lt; val:
      # update the maximum value
      max = val

  # finally, return result
  return max
</code></pre>
<p>It is actually not necessary to cycle also through the first element of the list, since variable <code>max</code> was initially set to its value, but it would be pretty ugly to use <code>while</code>-loop (see HW3.3) and other means of doing it were not yet discussed in lectures.</p>
<p>To repeat myself again, all you need to do is carefully observe all the steps you do, while computing the result manually:</p>
<ul>
<li>You note down the initial value (<code>0</code> is sufficient here, but the value of the first element, or at least negative infinity, i.e. the lowest possible value, would be better in general).</li>
<li>Then you go through all elements of the list, one by one</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>And for each of them, you compare the noted-down value with the element's value.</li>
<li>In case the element's value is higher than the noted-down value, you overwrite noted-down value by the element's value.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>At the end, you have the final result written in your note</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>HW3.5 Lists of Lists:</strong></p>
<p>And finally the concluding part of the series. However, this one is, besides <code>for</code> loop, also about lists of lists. It is about understanding the concept of list-inside-a-list and <code>for</code>-loop going through elements of a list.</p>
<pre><code>#Define a procedure, total_enrollment,
#that takes as an input a list of elements,
#where each element is a list containing

<p>I will not repeat the ""observe your manual steps"" story again, because it is the same all the time and this post is getting long anyway (In case someone is interested in it anyway, please post a note and I will write it to you as a reply.) What I will do, though, is that I will stress again that there are quite a lot of problems, which can be solved just using this very simple ""technique"".</p>
<p><strong>HW3.6 Max Pages:</strong></p>
<p>I can imagine that this one would look pretty scary at the first glance, but it turns out that it is not that bad. The only thing, which needs to be done is to introduce a counter of pages, which has been crowled, initialize it to 0 at the start (<code>{1}</code>), increment it for each page we crawl (<code>{2}</code>) and add condition, which will stop us when the counter reaches desired value (<code>{3}</code>).</p>
<pre><code>#Modify the crawl_web procedure
#to take a second parameter,
#max_pages, that limits the
#number of pages to crawl.
#Your procedure should
#terminate the crawl after
#max_pages different pages
#have been crawled, or when
#there are no more pages to crawl.

def crawl_web(seed,max_pages):
  tocrawl = [seed]
  crawled = []

  # {1}: no pages have been crawled, yet
  pages = 0

  # {3}: the second part of condition
  while tocrawl and pages &lt; max_pages:

    page = tocrawl.pop()
    if page not in crawled:
      union(tocrawl, get_all_links(get_page(page)))
      crawled.append(page)

      # {2}: a page has been crawled, increment counter
      pages = pages + 1

  return crawled
</code></pre>
<p><strong>HW3.7 Max Depth:</strong></p>
<p>This is where homework #3 starts to be challenging. In fact, I think that this two-star assignment is more difficult than HW3.8, which had three stars.</p>
<p>The basic thing, which needs to be solved here is how to store the current depth value, which needs to be compared against desired maximum. One possible, and very obvious to someone, with programming experience, is to make <code>crawl_web</code> function <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_%28computer_science%29"" rel=""nofollow"">recursively</a> call itself, just with <code>max_depth</code> lowered by one, for each URL returned by <code>get_all_links</code> function, until it needs to make call with <code>max_depth &lt; 0</code>. We would not even need <code>tocrawl</code> variable anymore, but we would need to pass <code>crawled</code> (or make it global variable, which is kind of ugly) - it is thus not viable solution, here, because we do not want to modify <code>crawl_web</code>'s header.</p>
<p>The thing about recursion is, each and every recursive function has its non-recursive equivalent using loops. The very same applies to above described solution:</p>
<pre><code>#TWO GOLD STARS#

#Modify the crawl_web procedure
#to take a second parameter,
#max_depth, that limits the
#minimum number of consecutive
#links that would need to be followed
#from the seed page to reach this
#page. For example, if max_depth
#is 0, the only page that should
#be crawled is the seed page.
#If max_depth is 1, the pages
#that should be crawled are the
#seed page and every page that links
#to it directly. If max_depth is 2,
#the crawl should also include all pages
#that are linked to by these pages.
</code></pre>
<p>def crawl_web(seed,max_depth):<br>
    tocrawl = [[0,[seed]]]<br>
    crawled = []</p>
<pre><code>while tocrawl:
  pages = tocrawl.pop()
  add_tocrawl = []
  for page in pages[1]:  # {1}
    if page not in crawled:
      if pages[0] &lt; max_depth: # {2}
        union(add_tocrawl, get_all_links(get_page(page)))
      crawled.append(page)
  if add_tocrawl: # {3}
    tocrawl.append([pages[0]+1, add_tocrawl])

return crawled
</code></pre>
<p>The depth of each URL (actually, of each <em>set of URLs</em>) is stored directly in <code>tocrawl</code> variable. Its format goes like this:</p>
<pre><code>tocrawl = [[&lt;depth1&gt;,
           [&lt;url11&gt;, &lt;url12&gt;, ..., &lt;url1N&gt;]],

           [&lt;depth2&gt;,
           [&lt;url21&gt;, &lt;url22&gt;, ..., &lt;url2N&gt;]],

           ...

           [&lt;depthN&gt;,
           [&lt;urlN1&gt;, &lt;urlN2&gt;, ..., &lt;urlNN&gt;]]]
</code></pre>
<p>This is not particularily nice, but it works and it can be written much nicer using <code>classes</code> and other tools of the language, which were not yet discussed in the lecture.</p>
<p>The rest of modifications to the function, after we solved the biggest problem of storing depth, is relatively straight forward. We need to add <code>for</code>-loop (<code>{1}</code>) to go through all URLs in <code>pages[1]</code> - that is new place for storing list of URLs to be crawled (<code>pages[0]</code> stores their depth - see above). The second modification is augmentation of algorithm for adding URLs to <code>tocrawl</code> list. We want to do that only in case we did not reach our <code>max_depth</code>, yet (<code>{2}</code>). Because we have changed structure of <code>tocrawl</code>, we do not want to add URLs to it right after we find them - we want to collect as many as we can into the <code>add_tocrawl</code>, mark them all with the depth value and insert whole such ""package"" (if it is not empty, of course) into <code>tocrawl</code> variable (<code>{3}</code>).</p>
<p>It should be noted, that above described solution is not the simplest one. It is not necessary to use an optimization, I have used, i.e. each URL might have its own depth-tag. In that case, <code>for</code>-loop (<code>{1}</code>) nor <code>add_tocrawl</code> variable would not be needed.</p>
<p><strong>HW3.8 Sudoku:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I posted my ""unit-test"" in <a href=""http://www.udacity-forums.com/cs101/questions/35230/hw38-test"" rel=""nofollow"">this thread</a>. Just copy-paste the code at the end of your code and run it.</p>
<p>There was <a href=""http://www.udacity-forums.com/cs101/questions/32928/anyone-solved-sudoku-with-less-than-9-lines-of-code"" rel=""nofollow"">lot of discussion</a> about 9-lines long solutions. I did not try to provide one so I do not know how does it look like and thus I can not judge it. However, I would like to emphasize that the better measure of code quality are its readability and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_oh"" rel=""nofollow"">complexity</a>. Do not take me wrong, however - it was explicitely stated by several people in that discussion that they agree with this and that the thread's purpose is just to provide kind of brain teaser for more experienced students (which is only commendable).</p>
<p>One more interesting thing in that discussion was post by <a href=""http://forums.udacity.com/users/100005361/peterudacity"">@PeterUdacity</a>, who wrote that in real Pythonic way, it can be done just on 4 lines of code. And this is very true, because in real life, you do not try to reinvent the wheel. There are lots of libraries out there, which can be used freely - and that is the ""Pythonic way"": ""I just imported antigravity""... Thus I would say that this 4-liner would look something like this (Disclaimer: I just know that there is some sudoku library for Python, but I do not know anything about it, thus the below code is just an example):</p>
<pre><code>1  import sudoku
2  
3  def check_sudoku(sudoku):
4    return sudoku.check(sudoku)
</code></pre>
<p>Anyway, my solution (those, who do have mentioned 9-liners correct, please paste them in answers, and especially, I would like to ask <a href=""http://forums.udacity.com/users/100008240/angel"">@Angel</a> to past his solution, which I was reading handles many very interesting cases) goes like this:</p>
<pre><code>#Define a procedure, check_sudoku,
#that takes as input a square list
#of lists representing an n x n
#sudoku puzzle solution and returns
#True if the input is a valid
#sudoku square and returns False
#otherwise.

#A valid sudoku square satisfies these
#two properties:

#   1. Each column of the square contains
#       each of the numbers from 1 to n exactly once.

#   2. Each row of the square contains each
#       of the numbers from 1 to n exactly once.

def check_sudoku(sudoku):
  n = len(sudoku)
  if n &lt; 1:
    return False

  for i in range(n):
    if len(sudoku[i]) != n:
      return False

    row_chk = []
    col_chk = []

    for k in range(n):
      row_chk.append(False)
      col_chk.append(False)

    for j in range(n):
      row_val = sudoku[i][j]
      if row_val &lt; 1 or n &lt; row_val or row_chk[row_val-1]:
        return False
      else:
        row_chk[row_val-1] = True

      col_val = sudoku[j][i]
      if col_val &lt; 1 or n &lt; col_val or col_chk[col_val-1]:
        return False
      else:
        col_chk[sudoku[j][i]-1] = True

  return True
</code></pre>
<p>We just go through all rows and columnsi (<code>{1}</code>) (in the same time - there is no point to do it twice, first time for rows and second time for columns, but this does not make much of a difference) and use auxiliary variables <code>row_chk</code> and <code>col_chk</code> to check that each row and each column contain one and exactly one occurence of each number from set <code>{1 .. n}</code>. Initially, those two auxiliary variables are set to be lists, containing only <code>False</code> values (<code>{2}</code>) and each time we find some number, we set corresponding <code>False</code> to <code>True</code> (<code>{3}</code>).</p>
<p>All the rest are just ""paranoid"" sanity checks (which, and much more of them, are really required in real-life scenario). E.g. we are checking value being out of range (otherwise, the algorithm would crash on ""index out of range"" error) (<code>{4}</code>).</p>"	"question"	"\N"	"\N"	"2012-03-14 00:00:43.865726+00"	"18"	""	"115281"	"100008306"	"2012-03-14 14:54:26.13811+00"	"47008"	"\N"	"\N"	"1543"	"f"

My thinking was that after the loop ran, even if e==x was True, the return -1 would always print out since that was the last return in the procedure.  I guess I'm confused how -1 is not always returned in this procedure; why isn't the last return printed out?</p>"	"question"	"\N"	"\N"	"2012-03-10 02:05:32.887818+00"	"0"	""	"100074624"	"100004394"	"2012-03-10 02:19:06.482506+00"	"100012828"	"\N"	"\N"	"118"	"f"

<p>I studied programing 7 years ago but i'm working as a IT so i consider my self a newbe programmer too, i'm too rusty 7 years without writting code is a very long time. I feel like theres a really big step between CS101 and this course, i think this sould be a CS313 and CS212 should be covering topics like:</p>
<p><strong>Object oriented programming:</strong> This wasn't cover in CS101 and i think this is very important for newcomers to know because is the next step to functional programming, when you learn OOP, you really start seeing thing from another perspective, concepts like reusing your code really come alive, doing wrapper libraries for more coplex libraries becomes easier etc.</p>
<p><strong>input/output:</strong> how to interact with files, internet(meaning sockets) and hardware (only a basic intro, and i know this is very dificult to grade in an online system), in the search engine we saw a basic intro to interacting with internet and i thinks this is one of this things that get people really insterested in programming, when you know how interact with the rest of the computer you really start scripting for your daily problems, you have a folder full of photos and want to automate the name, you write a script for that, you want your search engine to respond to some comands remotly, you open a socket and wait for commands (well it's more than that but you know), you want to make a powerfull robot to control earth, comunicate with arduino truoght python</p>
<p><strong>timing and optimization:</strong> well i haven't saw this in any programing book i ever read (that's provably cos i need to read more) and is how to manage time in your aplications. First use time, if you want to make a musical aplication you need time cos music is notes over time, if you want to make a game you need to refresh the screen every amount of time and this bring me to the second, you don't want your programn to take forever to do somenthing, so understanding time will help you do better programs, we saw a basic introduction to this in CS101 when we meassured the time it took to run the search functions, and i think this is a very good topic and we should go deeper to learn how to optimizate your code, and learnig concepts like events and interrupts are very usefull to take your projects to a more advance leve. So learning how to use python cprofile would be very usufull.<br>
<a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/profile.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/library/profile.html</a></p>
<p><strong>multythreads:</strong> this is posible in python too, well at least as an introducction, if you want serious multythreads you want to use pypy i think. This is one of those topics that people should be introduce to since is one of those thing that make your programs ""proffessional"", real programs work in this way you have various threads that do different things, like file i/o (wich is slow) and other thread let you keep using the program while you save your file, this gives you a sensation of multitasking, then the threads sync and so on. This and how to run code in parallel (for multicore machines) is great suplemental material for the cryptography course and for mathematicians and phycisist and all the people that need to solve really computational expensive problems and don't know about programming.</p>
<p><strong>GUI programming:</strong> This is provably an entire course of it's own but i think it's worth mentioning that with libraries like GTK or QT you can write graphical programs for windows,linux and mac in python, pygame is also worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Well that's what i think it would be a good continuation of the CS101 some of them are more posible to teach in an online eviroment than others, and if someone have more ideas or can add or correct thing that i said, please post since this is very constructive for the teachers at udacity, I only ask for politness since the teachers are working very hard to make this plataform so we can suggest but not demand.</p>
<p>Finally i would like to thank all the people that make possible udacity, i'm enjoing a lot the courses and i would visit as much as i can.</p>

I agree with your comment about using the ptr twice.. it is effective but I do not like it.  I tried different options but what ended up happening was that my allocations became buried in libraries and now I seldom have a need to use safe_malloc() directly so it stop bothering me.  The benefits are still there, though.  All I have to do is to use malloc_objects_num() at the end of the program.</p>
<p>Another possible advantage of using macros is that you could have it work as a normal malloc() or as safe_malloc() depending on a flag.  There are some pathological data structures, llke double-linked lists, that use mallocs so often that it might make sense to use safe_malloc() only while developing the application and then, once you are reasonably sure that there is no memory leak, go back to the normal malloc to avoid the penalty of calling an additional function and the cost of the addition or substraction every time that the 'safe' routines are called.</p>"	"comment"	"12003270"	"12003175"	"2012-08-02 04:54:11.659652+00"	"0"	""	"\N"	"100008281"	"2012-08-02 04:54:11.659652+00"	"12004511"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>I don't get what you mean.  Could you expand more on what you mean in that ""a-bar"" isn't constant.  ""a-bar"" is constant in the velocity equations, it's just that factors that can adjust ""a-bar"" are included, in the event we're dealing with a changing ""a"" in the displacement equation (such as when the distance (r) between two space-bodies is greatly increasing or decreasing).</p>

What about mu?  One of the conclusions of the central limit theorem is that the mean of all the sample means will be the same as the mean of the original population. So, mu is technically mu-sub-xbar, but since that is equal to mu we just write that.</p>
<p>So what we are doing is comparing our sample mean with the mean of all possible sample means that could be drawn from this population (for samples of size 36).  And then we are assessing how unusual this occurance is by converting it to standardized score, i.e. by dividing by sigma/sqrt(n).   Here we are assuming that the original distribution has a std. deviation of sigma, but the std. deviation of the sampling distribution is sigma/sqrt(n).  </p>
<p>The concept of a sampling distribution is really deep and takes time to digest. Kudos to you for trying to understand this and not take it at face value.  As we are trying to make a decision about the population mean by using a sample, it really helps to know about the sampling distribution.  If we know the mean and the std. deviation of the sampling distribution, we can figure out how far out along the normal curve the sample occurrance that we have observed falls, which in turn will help with the final decision.</p>
<p>""I believe we have an average of means (in your example this average is 10.8) and we therefore have to use an average of the variances for each sample. That is why we have to divide by sigma/sqrt(n) right?<br>
""<br>
10.8 is the mean of just one sample.  But, we are comparing this sample mean with all the sample means that could be drawn from this population.  That's why we are using sigma/sqrt(n).  By the way, if we pick a sample of just 1, sigma/sqrt(n) would be just sigma.  As the sample size (n) gets larger, sigma/sqrt(n) gets smaller, which should make sense since the mean of larger samples will be more reliable and won't fluctuate as much. </p>
<p>""Could we also calculate a z value for each laptop and add take that average?""  This will lead to (xbar-mu)/ sigma which is not the correct formula for samples of size larger than 1.</p>"	"comment"	"10009472"	"10009406"	"2012-08-02 01:18:54.173509+00"	"1"	""	"\N"	"100064408"	"2012-08-02 01:18:54.173509+00"	"10014276"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>In hindsight, this is obvious since my implementation adds the same node to heap multiple times and just ignores some values (this problem will be exacerbated in dense graphs).</p>

<p>To obtain the variance over the combined distribution, I still have to add the variances (although these are variances for the averages of the experiments, not over the original random variable), so the variance of the combined distribution for the average of experiments is: $%\frac{\sigma_{A}^2}{N_{A}} + \frac{\sigma_{B}^2}{N_{B}}$%</p>

"61042"	"Webmaster partner needed for competition, trip to Palo Alto,"	"cs101 partner team competition contest"	"100008230"	"<p>I posted this in the Done! thread, but have had no takers yet.</p>
<p>Now that I am a gentleman of leisure again, I can give some thought to the contest. I have coded an app that has a good shot at winning, but it would be more fun for everyone if it had a Web interface. I can do simple HTML, but haven't learned to do graphic controls (e.g., a slider to enter a floating-point parameter). Also, my ChromeBook isn't a good development environment, and I have yet to spin up Python on my older Mac.  And I don't have a website or a server account. And I've never run a distributed project, so it would good to have a partner who knows how to do that (even though it's not really necessary here).</p>
<p>I'm looking specifically for a partner worthy of the Palo Alto visit, as I have no need to claim that prize myself. You don't need strong Python skills, but there has to be some reason I would pick you over other applicants.  I would prefer someone not working on other projects, just to spread the opportunity around -- but I could be flexible on that.  My criteria involve what you can do for the contest entry, what you might do for Udacity (just in case they are thinking of this as an interview), and what the trip could do for you.  (Furthest distance could well be a tie breaker. :-)</p>
<p>My app parses text, builds a grammar, and generates new text in the same style. Not quality text, of course, but sufficient to be entertaining. I know, many CS students have built such a thing; many have even built full chatbots -- but this one is simple, initialized for course-related material, and works very well.  A crystalline gem, if I do say so, yet developed with very little effort. (I've wanted to write this app for 35 years. Python is great, and CS101 taught me all I needed. Thanks, Dave!)  The code currently uses only CS101 techniques -- including dictionaries -- though Web hosting might require file I/O and other simple changes. (We can submit the callable non-Web version as well.)</p>
<p>My app doesn't do any Web search. It's possible for someone -- a third team member? -- to add that, but would require some moderately difficult Web scraping to find and extract relevant page content. I can help with further Python coding as necessary. The interactive interface controls and Web hosting are fundamental, and beyond my current ability. We can consider other development directions that may interest you, but I believe the above is sufficient for the contest.</p>
<p>My contribution will be the concept and the core code. I intend to retain any rights to the code not granted to the contest, including commercial rights, just in case this is my last shot at fame and fortune. You would likewise retain rights to your contributions, and the right to run my code for your own noncommercial use or as allowed by the Udacity license.</p>
<p>I'm sure there will be stiff competition, including genuinely useful apps, but I think we've got a shot at winning one of the trips.  To volunteer, write to kilaws@gmail.com.  Or you can reply here and give me your contact info.</p>"	"question"	"\N"	"\N"	"2012-04-09 21:44:00.641545+00"	"3"	""	"\N"	"100005396"	"2012-04-12 18:03:24.916174+00"	"80670"	"\N"	"\N"	"415"	"f"

<p>Sweet mercy!! I buy books like I'm rich or something! WTS? At any rate...answer with what you've currently picked up or heck even if you consider it a classic. It doesn't necessarily have to be development related but I'm hoping not to have to wade through a bunch of cookbooks or anything. I love Julia Childs as much as the next guy but I doubt I'm going to be pulling the trigger on The Art of French Cooking anytime soon.</p>
<p>Admittedly I broke a cardinal rule and didn't search before posting. If this question has already been asked please direct me there and I'll close this down.</p>
<p>Thanks for the time :)</p>
<p>UPDATE: Bump because I'm hoping to get some more book ideas and I haven't heard from a couple folks I was hoping to get input from.</p>

<p>Imagine an immense cloud of gas and dust in space. This cloud is likely to have some rotation on it. But that rotation may be very, very little. Of course, this gas cloud will want to start to collapse in on itself due to gravity.</p>
<p>As the cloud collapses, its rotation must increase to conserve rotational momentum. To get an idea what I mean, think of an ice skater spinning in place with their arms held out. Now the skater pulls their arms in, and they rotate faster. You can test this out if you have a chair that rotates easily, as well. Put your arms and legs out as you spin, your spin will decrease. Pull them in, and you spin faster.</p>
<p>The gas cloud does the same thing. And so it rotates faster and faster as the cloud collapses. At some point, it starts to glow as it becomes a protostar. And some point after that, fusion begins to occur in the star, and our new star is born! Any rotation at all in the initial gas cloud is magnified as it collapses, leaving a star spinning faster than the original gas cloud.</p>
<p>If you can find someone with a telescope, you can see it, as well. There are often sunspots on the surface, and they give you a reference point by which you can tell it's rotating, if you look at it over a period of time.</p>

<p>In the link you post about (http://math.elon.edu/statistics112/hyp_testing.html) it shows the test statistic formula as x-bar - mu. Shouldn't this be x double bar or something else besides x-bar? Isn't x-bar just a sample average, and aren't we in fact talking about the average of a bunch of sample averages? Or am I being too pedantic here and should accept x-bar as a sample average. I remember a post form Ken Laws discussing notation and after reading that page I think I see his point.</p>
<p>With a lot of help I think I understand what the test statistic formula is really doing. I believe we have an average of means (in your example this average is 10.8) and we therefore have to use an average of the variances for each sample.  That is why we have to divide by sigma/sqrt(n) right?  </p>
<p>Could we also calculate a z value for each laptop and add take that average? I don't see how we get the square root of n term if we do that but my intuition tells me it should be possible.</p>"	"comment"	"10009472"	"10009406"	"2012-08-01 18:42:48.999068+00"	"0"	""	"\N"	"100002126"	"2012-08-01 18:42:48.999068+00"	"10014191"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

"10010025"	""	"st101 "	"100008230"	"<p>First, let me correct what I said above about Bessel's correction.  The N/(N-1) correction is not about the square root.  That's a separate issue, about the standard deviation being even more biased than the variance and thus needing an even larger correction -- typically around N/(N-1.5), but varying with N.  I've carried some confusion about this for a long time, and now I seem to be infecting others with it.  Anyway, the variance itself needs the N/(N-1) correction in order to be unbiased, and the reason is that we are computing the average squared deviation around the sample mean instead of the around the population mean.  Sample values are closer to their own mean than to the population mean, so the variance is underestimated.  We use Bessel's correction to compute a slightly larger variance that has the desired expectation (i.e., average over an infinite number of experiments) of $%\sigma^2$%.</p>
<p>Now, to your question:</p>
<p>If we know the true population variance, we have no need to estimate it.  We should discard any estimates, since we know they are unreliable compared to our prior knowledge of the process.  (Using Bayesian estimation, we can assign a confidence to our prior knowledge and can then <em>more or less</em> discard new estimates as they are offered.  But for now let's assume that we either know $%\sigma^2$% or are completely ignorant of it.)</p>
<p>If we don't know $%\sigma^2$%, we don't know which sample variances $%s^2_i$% are too high.  Some are higher than others, of course.  We could arbitrarily throw out the highest and lowest, as Sebastian did with his quartile-based outlier removal, but that's not our best option.</p>
<p>Instead, we average all of our sample variances $%s_i^2$% to get $%\bar{s}^2$%, the average sample variance over an ensemble of sampling experiments.  This is an estimator, also called $%\hat{\sigma}^2$%, of the population variance.</p>
<p>(If we only have one sample, that's OK too.  We just use that one sample variance as our estimate.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the estimator is biased.  What it really estimates is $%\frac{N-1}{N}\sigma^2$%.  (So why did we say it estimated $%\sigma^2$%?

The coin flips are considered to be repeated draws (or ""trials"") from a Bernoulli (or 0-1) distribution, and the population would be that of all possible Bernoulli events.  Put more simply, the population is the set of one head and one tail, drawn ""with replacement.""  (Or, just as valid, an infinite, balanced population of heads and tails, drawn with or without replacement.)  The distribution is a probability 0.5 of drawing a head (1) and 0.5 of drawing a tail (0).</p>
<p>Or we could think of this as sampling from a binomial population, if we draw multiple times and count the number of heads (irrespective of the order).  The concept gets confusing because there is a different binomial population for each N -- from which we take a sample of one draw -- but the math all works out to the same answers.</p>
<p>If we draw from the set (1, 2, 3) without replacement, the conceptual framework gets more complex.  As you say, once we have drawn one of the elements, we no longer have the same population for the second draw.  The probabilities on the second draw are dependent on the first draw, so we no longer have the i.i.d. samples that statisticians love.  The tools of Statistics are of little use, and we are instead in the domain of Probability Theory.  (We can still talk of means and variances, but must compute them by considering all possible sequences of draws.)</p>
<p>This is different from Bessel's correction for small samples with i.i.d. draws.  Bessel's correction has to do with the effect of taking the square root of an unbiased estimator (the variance $%\sigma^2$%).  Because the square root is a concave function (i.e., curving upward), it produces a sample statistic that always underestimates the corresponding population statistic $%\sigma$%.  Without the correction, N would have to be infinite before the bias disappears (though in practice 30 is usually close enough).  With the correction, there is no bias.  (But the mean square error of the corrected $%s$% is a bit higher than for the biased statistic $%s_n$%.  Alas, there is no free lunch, and Statistics is a complex, tricky business when you get this deep into the theory.)</p>
<p>It would be possible to talk about a small-sample correction for drawing without replacement from a finite set, but the math would be complicated.  We'd have to work it out for each sequence of draws, or at least for equivalence classes of them.  It's not something a statistician would usually consider, unless faced with an important physical problem that motivates the analysis.</p>"	"comment"	"10009976"	"10006157"	"2012-08-01 15:17:00.593668+00"	"0"	""	"\N"	"100008230"	"2012-08-01 15:17:00.593668+00"	"10014151"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>So why this is incorrect? In another topic i read about using while loop with &gt;= operator like this:</p>

<pre><code>while n &gt;= 1:

<p>or like this:</p>

<pre><code>while 0 &lt; i:

<p>Mathematically, a%m can be defined as the integer r which is greater than or equal to 0 and strictly less than m such that m divides (a-r); or equivalently r-a if you're uncomfortable when a is negative.</p>"	"answer"	"1005382"	"1005382"	"2012-02-27 15:42:41.144527+00"	"1"	""	"1021399"	"100000129"	"2012-02-27 16:36:00.240394+00"	"1007495"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

I tried about 3 different functions from random and then assumed that none of random functions would work with set(). <a href=""http://forums.udacity.com/users/100050730/carmen"">@Carmen</a>, set() is really cool. Its operations are very close to sets from math, so it's very intuitive to manipulate set(). You can make all sorts of cool things:</p>

It seems to just return the numbers in order. A good thing to keep in mind. You can't use choice (without turning it into a list), but you can use random.sample like this:</p>
<pre><code>picked = random.sample(doors, 1)[0]
</code></pre>
<p>Sample can return multiple randomly picked elements (note the last argument, which is just 1 in this case), and returns a list, hence the [0] at the end. Mind you, in <a href=""http://forums.udacity.com/users/100012003/marcio-gualtieri""><a href=""http://forums.udacity.com/users/100012003/marcio-gualtieri""><a href=""http://forums.udacity.com/users/100012003/marcio-gualtieri""><a href=""http://forums.udacity.com/users/100012003/marcio-gualtieri"">@Marcio</a></a></a></a>'s case, two elements are sampled right off, so it might make sense to sample 2 elements at the start.</p>
<p>If you have one element left in the set and you want to extract it, I suppose that would be a good place for set.pop(). It can't really fail to give you the only element in the set.</p>

<p>For this course, ""problem"" is perhaps a bit strong, since the counter-examples require using JavaScript syntax that was not covered in class and is not a direct translation of Python (cf. elif vs. else if). Our primary goal is making the eventual interpreter easier for students to write, even if that means making it a little harder for people who have outside knowledge of JavaScript.</p>
<p>That said, I don't want students to be frustrated, so I have made changes so that our interpreter accepts both Rajeev's example and your github example ""out of the box"". Time permitting, Peter may be able to push those changes to the grading servers to help with any subsequent JavaScript assignments or subsequent runs of this class. </p>
<p>I do want to thank the two of you for bringing this additional possible source of frustration to our attention. I think you (and the students who complained earlier) have made the world a better place for future students. That said, this line of work does reach diminishing returns quickly -- it is not necessarily a good use of time to support every possible JavaScript corner case. </p>

<p>1.- Dumping factor (d): It says when or how often we have to choose another page 'randomly' to start over searching.  Here the question: Which page we should select, ok one at random, but which is the 'Universe of pages' where we have to pick one up? <br>
2.- How many time should we star over? Like a recursive function it must have a base case, doesn't it?</p>
<p>To clarify a bit: If we take Homework 6.5, You have taken this url ('http://udacity.com/cs101x/urank/index.html') as root to start crawling process and you are looking for 'Hummus'.  Everything it's ok so far. My point is, surely If I had chosen another url as root the result would have been better.  So that why I'm asking question '1'.  I'm not talking specifically about this Universe (the universe of hw6.5) I'm refering the real world Universe.</p>

"43333"	"Course, contest and few other questions"	"cs101 libraries ranking suggestions certificate contest"	"100007482"	"<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Course in general</strong><br><br>
 1.1. <strong>Concatenation of certificates</strong><br><br>
It has been mentioned that we'll receive a certificate upon successful completion of this course. Though although it would be nice to count all the classes that we've attended and hopefully passed, as it is going, soon they will take more than majority of the resume.<br><br><br>
It's not a bad thing but, with case of someone going to college/university, they don't count 40'ish classes that they attended, but just the degree that they received. Now I'm not asking for a degree, but am mostly interested if, after completion of several courses, sort of concatenation of them will be offered as an e-certificate?<br><br><br>
So... if I complete one course, I can put it on my resume but if I would complete 5 courses of which 3 are computer related and 2... let's say medical related, I would just have to mention them individually. But if I would complete 5 (or more/less) of them from the same field such as Building a Search Engine, Design of Computer Programs, Web Application Engineering, Programming Languages and let's say Programming A Robotic Car, I'd be eligible for... <strong>Udacity's Programmer e-certificate</strong>, so I could put just that one and anyone that is interested can easily google to find out what is required for it.<br><br><br>
Well not exactly those classes since Programming A Robotic Car is apparently for advanced, but collection of classes with similar difficulty.<br><br><br>
 1.2. <strong>Retaking classes</strong><br><br>
Although this one is probably a ""duh..."" question, it is still better to ask. If we're not satisfied with our final grade, can we retake the class and keep ""better"" certificate? Or it's more of a ""Can retake as long as you don't pass it, and when you do, it's done""</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contest</strong><br><br>
 2.1. <strong>Libraries, robots.txt and such</strong><br><br>
Will we be able to use libraries when building a search engine for the contest at the end of a class. Will it ""have"" to obey the robots.txt.<br><br>
Well, what I'm mostly interested in is... would there be a chance for someone that just started to program to actually win with ""if-then-else"" type of programming or will they surely fail compared to those that will use regex, machine learning and some libraries that half of population haven't even heard about yet?<br><br><br>
 2.2. <strong>Ranking</strong><br><br>
How will search engines be ranked? How will algorithms be compared to others? By the execution speed? By the number of pages they can index, or by the results it will give on searching for specific keywords.<br><br>
Will the testing environment be controlled or it will be an actual Internet.<br><br>
If Internet, will it use our desktops/servers(if someone has one/some)/bandwidth or will it be uploaded and then executed on your computers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Suggestions</strong><br><br>
 3.1. <strong>Teamspeak/Ventrilo/Mumble</strong><br><br>
If Google's software for communicating is crashing a lot, why not use an alternative such as Teamspeak, Ventrilo or Mumble?<br><br><br>
 3.2. <strong>Wiki</strong><br><br>
This is more from the MITx, but I liked the idea of having a Wiki that students could edit and expand. Even without the books or references, attendees would have nice amount of information to read. And although you can find most of information on forums, wiki would be more structured and easier to search.<br><br><br>
 3.3. <strong>One registration for Udacity forum</strong><br><br>
Considering it's on the same domain, it's bit weird that I had to register on CS101 forums and CS373. Wouldn't it be simpler to register just once and have access to all forums of classes that someone attends?</p>

<p>HOMEWORK 1 EXTENSION AND SCHEDULE CLARIFICATION<br>
Peter Chapman - 07:23:09 AM Feb 27, 2012  </p>
<p>In the hectic days prior to launch we had some internal miscommunication about homework due dates for CS 373. This led to conflicting information presented in various course documents.  </p>
<p>We’d like to apologize for any confusion that this has caused. We want to ensure that none of our students are unfairly penalized for this mistake so <strong>we are extending the due date for the first homework to Wednesday at 23:59 UTC. This extension applies to the first homework only!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Future homeworks for CS 373: Programming a Robotic Car will be due on Mondays at 23:59 UTC.</strong> New homework assignments for CS 373 will be released on Mondays at 23:59 UTC.  </p>
<p>We will be posting the homework for Unit 2 according to this schedule, so this week there will be a brief period of overlap where the homework for Units 1 and 2 will both be out.  </p>
<p>Unit 2 lectures will be posted in the next 24 hours.  </p>
<p>We will keep registration open, so it is not to late for new students to join the class.  </p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding. Keep learning!</p>

"58523"	"My experience with Udacity (so far...)"	"cs101 learning udacity future advice experience"	"100008225"	"<p>Brief history:</p>
<p>I have wanted to learn to write code since I can remember.  I took an AP Computer Science course in high school, and did quite well at it.  I spent a semester in University as an ""Undecided"" major, although my courses were geared towards Computer Science.  A rough patch came up in my personal life that required me to leave school and begin working, but I never stopped wanting to learn how to control and manipulate my computer to complete various tasks for me.  I have found all ""by yourself"" means of learning to program insufficient for my particular learning style (how-to books, internet sites promising to teach you <em>xxx</em> language).  With no deadlines, and lacking a specific direction, I often found that I would stray from completing anything worthwhile.</p>
<p>Flash to present:</p>
<p>It's been over 10 years since I dabbled in actual programming in any structured way.  When I read about Udacity, my first thought was, ""if it sounds to good to be true, it probably is.""  I figured there would be a hidden fee, or some other gimmick once you got your foot in the door.  Obviously that skepticism proved false, and here I am, having completed my first Udacity course successfully (because I feel I have a solid grasp of the material, since I don't know my grade yet).</p>
<p>I'm thrilled by the prospect of what is happening here, and to think that I'm in on the ""ground floor"" so to speak is incredible indeed.  I'm excited about the two courses I signed up for this next hexamester, and I am quite enjoying the community that has developed (even though I'm not the MOST involved in it).</p>
<p>Something I found that helped:</p>
<p>Frequently throughout this course I found it invaluable to ""code"" in an environment where I couldn't use an actual interpreter.  I found that this forced me to run through my code and keep track of each iteration (or recursion) to find out the results.  It gave me a better understanding of the internal workings of the code, and the language in general. I am sure there would be some difficulties using this approach while working on more complex programs, but then again, if you're accomplishing abstraction well, it's a feasible way to approach a problem you're struggling to get your head around.<br>
In addition to the above advice, I can't stress enough how helpful I found these forums, in general.  There were, of course, the distracting posts, but for the most part, there were many times that a simple comment or thought presented in the forums helped something click into place in my head, and allowed me to get over a hurdle.</p>
<p>The reason for my post here:</p>
<p>I thought people could share a few things in this area.<br>
1). What is/are your thoughts on your Udacity experience after the first course (or JUST ABOUT after, if you haven't submitted the final exam yet)<br>
2.) Since many of us are taking an online course for the first time, and in addition, since many of us are entirely new (or almost new) to programming, did you stumble upon any techniques that helped you when things weren't so smooth?  How did you finally find the solution after many hours of being stuck on a problem?  How did you juggle this course with your real world every day life?</p>
<p>~ Thanks guys, happy learning/coding!</p>"	"question"	"\N"	"\N"	"2012-04-06 17:25:01.696165+00"	"0"	""	"\N"	"100008225"	"2012-04-06 21:06:24.12038+00"	"77363"	"\N"	"\N"	"595"	"f"

Not that my original plan was wrong (perhaps), but I saw a better approach and couldn't resist starting again from scratch to ""do it right.""</p>
<p>For those of you new to Computer Science, there is a scheduling formula that is commonly applied in software engineering and the management of programmers.  If a programmer says he can do a job in a minute, be grateful if he gets back to you in less than two hours.  If he estimates an hour, allow two days.  Likewise a day means two weeks; a week means two months; a month means two years; and a year means you can't expect results within the current budget cycle.  The general formula is that you double the given number and increment the temporal unit.</p>
<p>I ran across this formula decades ago (in Fred Brook's <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em>?) and have found it to be generally accurate.  Experienced programmers can produce code much faster than beginners, but will also be tackling harder problems.  And they will add extra bells and whistles, or do a few extra test runs, just because they ""have more time"" before their schedule slip starts to feel serious.</p>
<p>The management lesson is obvious: allow more time.  Lots more time.  ""Software always takes longer.""  (Longer than what?  Doesn't matter.  It will take longer.)</p>
<p>The lessons for programmers are less obvious.  Start with ""curb your expectations,"" of course, but throw in a pinch of ""don't beat yourself up over it.""  Keep Scotty's ""I canna' change the laws of physics!"" on the tip of your tongue, but know that sometimes you can beat a deadline if you have to -- and sometimes you can't, and won't be able to solve the problem at all.  And sometimes it won't be your fault, as with our inability today to run or submit code on the Udacity server.  And sometimes it will be your fault, and someone else will point out what should have been obvious to you.</p>
<p>Why do we always overestimate our abilities and underestimate time required?  My personal belief -- 'sorry if it offends anyone -- is that self-esteem problems are a principle cause.  (That and simply not being able to envision all the difficulties until confronted by them.)  When asked for a guess, or even when generating them internally, we want to appear competent.  Many programmers are of the nerd persuasion, and programming is one of their core competencies; hence a very strong need to feel proficient and to appear proficient.  The result of this social urge is denial.  And the more often the programmer falls behind desired or promised performance, the stronger the social need and the stronger the denial.  ""Doing it right"" becomes an obsession, partly to make up for so often turning it in late.  The programmer lives with shame, and compensates with a gloss of fantasy and perfectionism.  If you enter this field, and care about it, know that this is a demon you will encounter.  The demon can destroy your self-esteem, and your marriage, possibly even your job (usually the last thing lost before serious depression, sometimes breakdown or suicide).  But programming is also a magnificent obsession, and worth living with the demon.</p>
<p>Hubris is necessary in a great programmer; so is humility.  The field will teach you both.</p>"	"question"	"\N"	"\N"	"2012-04-06 17:27:34.670916+00"	"12"	""	"\N"	"148606112"	"2013-09-18 10:07:51.082666+00"	"77366"	"\N"	"\N"	"749"	"f"

<p>Computer science and computer programming are not the same thing but there is no reason computer science couldn't be taught with examples that demonstrate good programming.</p>
<p>I still cringe every time I think of Sean Bennett's challenge to try and beat his lines of code. Unless you are Alan Kay, focusing on lines of code is almost always the wrong path to quality.</p>
<p>I think it would be great if the community reviewed a few code examples for each problem set. After the community discussed and refined the code the best solutions could be saved and presented as official answers.  I think this would be better than the shoot from the hip stuff the instructors are doing right now.

<p>Naftali, I am sure you mean well, and your comments are thoughtful, but you do rather seem to miss the point. I am sure that there are people who find my tone rather over the top. </p>
<p>But the point here is not the code. The problem is there was no spec as to what the answer should produce. You write a program, get it working, submit it and you get the ""Sorry, though luck, please guess again"" message. And without a spec, or test cases to validate against that is exactly what it is. A guess.</p>
<p>And that is very frustrating. Now if I cannot get a bit of code working that is fine. I need to try harder, and I do. But just trying every possible combination of types / formats / nesting is not fun.</p>
<p>In addition to this the fact that there were errors in a number of the model answers did not help.</p>
<p>Now I am in the situation where I do not have enough time to complete the homework. Not because I do not understand. Not because the course is that hard, but because I wasted three days banging my head against the submission process.</p>
<p>Oh well, just have to keep at it, I really should have skipped those items where I had the correct answer but could not submit it. I just find it hard to do that.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I do agree with your sentiments re not giving up. I am sure that there are other students who have had the same frustrating experience, and no one should give up because of this.  Just keep going.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, to find the variance of the mean let us use a similar example. Roll 10 dice. Average the outcomes and place this in a list, say M. Repeat the same experiment and record the average in M. When we do this 100 times, M should have 100 averages in it. What would be the variance of all of those 100 averages that we have recorded? So now the question is var((X1 + X2 ...+ Xn)/n )=? You might now be able to figure this one and if not, let us know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So after 100 rolls we have the average variance of X1 through Xn. So we just sum these up and multiply but 1/n^2 or 1/100?

<p>As for the 3 vs 4. The <strong>length of the substring you are trying to find</strong> is 3. Which means that the next occurrence of the substring can be 3 positions after the first occurrence of it. It will not be accepted as a correct solution, because it fails for test string 'zipzip'.

<p>HOMEWORK 1 EXTENSION AND SCHEDULE CLARIFICATION<br>
Peter Chapman - 07:23:09 AM Feb 27, 2012  </p>
<p>In the hectic days prior to launch we had some internal miscommunication about homework due dates for CS 373. This led to conflicting information presented in various course documents.  </p>
<p>We’d like to apologize for any confusion that this has caused. We want to ensure that none of our students are unfairly penalized for this mistake so <strong>we are extending the due date for the first homework to Wednesday at 23:59 UTC. This extension applies to the first homework only!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Future homeworks for CS 373: Programming a Robotic Car will be due on Mondays at 23:59 UTC.</strong> New homework assignments for CS 373 will be released on Mondays at 23:59 UTC.  </p>
<p>We will be posting the homework for Unit 2 according to this schedule, so this week there will be a brief period of overlap where the homework for Units 1 and 2 will both be out.  </p>
<p>Unit 2 lectures will be posted in the next 24 hours.  </p>
<p>We will keep registration open, so it is not to late for new students to join the class.  </p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding. Keep learning!</p>

<p>I would say that's one reason I write simulations like this to correspond as directly as possible with the process I'm simulating. For one, less chance of making an incorrect assumption. And I'm trying to simulate the process as closely as possible and make it convincing. Though if the problem as stated is intractable, of course, shortcuts will be taken.</p>
<p>So I guess you could say, though the logic is good, the above solution isn't a faithful simulation, strictly speaking.</p>

When you're summing random variables, you get a random variable whose mean is the sum of the means, and whose variance is the sum of the variances of these variables. This is what's happening with the coin flips, and that is the general result: the resulting mean and variance is the sum of all the means and variances (think about the random walk. It's the same thing).</p>
<p>Now, for the variance of the mean, you basically just use a result that was obtained previously, that $%Var(aX)=a^2Var(X)$%. To make things clearer:</p>
<p>You found the mean and variance of the sums or coin flips, or $%\Sigma X_i$%, where each $%X_i$% is a coin flip. But what you're trying to get isn't $%\Sigma X_i$%, but rather $%\frac 1 N\Sigma X_i$%. Then it's simple: use the rule of the variance multiplication above to find that $%Var(\frac 1 N\Sigma X_i)=\frac {1}{N^2} Var(\Sigma X_i)$%. You already have all of the $%\Sigma X_i$%, since $%Var(\Sigma X_i)=\Sigma Var(X_i)$%, so you divide each by $%N^2$%.</p>"	"comment"	"10009258"	"10009256"	"2012-07-31 02:22:05.611846+00"	"1"	""	"10114020"	"100011911"	"2012-07-31 02:27:35.190548+00"	"10013805"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>However, when we consider the use of self-driving cars more broadly, we'll see that they result in massive environmental benefits. The key change that facilitates different use is that they can be automatically delivered when you need the car. This means that you don't need your car to sit around idle for 95% of its life. This should reduce the number of cars manufactured by up to an order of magnitude. Furthermore, such a model would speed the transition to electric cars if it hasn't already occurred. Since they're already more economical at higher mileage amounts, they would be used except in the small percentage of cases where range is a concern. Furthermore, electric cars used by such a service wouldn't need as large batteries since the distribution of ranges could be matched (conservatively) with the distribution of trip lengths as opposed to the current bias for buying the longest range one might need. The same also goes for vehicle sizes: They could be matched to the distribution of trip capacity requirements since you could request a larger car for extreme trips with no additional overhead. Lastly, most of the land currently used for parking could be repurposed.</p>

"1010706"	""	"cs373 "	"100027424"	"<p>The reason the variance only goes down is that we omitted control variance. If you include uncertain movement, convergence depends on the relationship between measurement variance and control variance. If control variance is high, it doesn't necessarily converge at all.</p>
<p>I'll try to explain K: K is just the generalization of the single dimension gain factor. In one dimension for variables with means v and n and variances r and m, our new estimate was (rn+mv)/(m+r). We can rewrite this in terms of the adjustment to the current state by subtracting n. So the adjustment is (rn+mv-nm-nr)/(m+r)=m(v-n)/(m+r). This is simply the one dimensional version of <code>x=x+(P*H.T*(H*P*H.T+R).I)(z-Hx)</code> where A.I is the inverse of A and A.T is the transpose of T. Because of the length of the equation, it's usually written in several pieces: S represents the total variance and is equivalent to (m+r). K is the adjust factor applied to the difference m/(m+r). y is the difference (v-n). </p>
<p>While this might make it easier to see how this is a generalization of the single dimensional case, it elides over some new concepts introduced, namely hidden variables and covariance. Let's work through a simple example to see how these work. Consider the example in class of tracking a point moving along a line by its position and speed. Let's start with S. This is supposed to represent the total variance. R is a single number that represents the variance of the measurement. If we had multiple measurements, it would be have not only the sensor errors but also the covariance of them. To that we need to add the uncertainty of the measurement given the system. While we have two state variables, we're only measuring one of them which is represented by H=[[1,0]]. The first H*P gives us a 1x2 matrix with the first entry being the variance of the position and the second the covariance of position and speed. Multiplying by H.T leaves us with just the variance of position. Adding that to R gives us our total variance. Note that H would have more interesting behavior if our measurements were actually sums of state variables. In that case it would actually add variances.  </p>
<p>Now that we've shown that our denominator is the total variance, we need to show that the numerator is the variance of the state which gives us the weight to apply to the update. The complication over the single variable case is that K has two entries since it needs to provide updates for each state variable based on the measurement. To compute we multiply <code>P*H.T</code> which gives us a 2x1 matrix with the first entry being the variance of the state position and the second being the covariance of the state speed and position. This is one of the two steps that enables the Kalman filter to infer speed. To see how, note that after the first motion step, F creates covariance between state and motion. Let's quickly multiply F to see the magnitude. <code>F=[[1,dt],[0,1]]</code>. For uncertain but uncorrelated position and motion we have <code>P=[[a,0],[0,b]]</code>.  <code>F*P=[[a,b*dt],[0,b]]</code>. Multiplying by F transpose yields: <code>[[a+b*dt^2,b*dt],[b*dt,b]]</code>. Then in computing K, speed is updated with a weight of <code>b*dt/(a+b*dt^2+R)</code>. So to the extent the uncertainty in position is small and measurement noise is low, speed is simply updated by multiplying the change in position by 1/dt which is equivalent to calculating speed!</p>"	"answer"	"1010579"	"1010579"	"2012-03-02 18:38:15.432345+00"	"6"	""	"1041658"	"100003706"	"2012-03-09 02:23:31.25409+00"	"1014742"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>I think that there should be some more differences in grading. For instance, if a program passes all test cases but one, that probably means that someone didn't think about a certain edge case. I don't think that this should result in an 'incorrect', but in a '50% correct' or something like that. So you still get some credit for how you solved the problem.</p>
<p>And possibly, it could also give some automated feedback. When someone forgot a certain edge case, you can tell that the test cases that failed, where for that edge case.</p>

<p>As an Information Systems major, I can confirm that fndmntl and Gibgezr's answers are spot-on, except I wouldn't call it ""Diet CS"".  It concentrates on a broader range of topics than what CS does, while CS focuses on programming. Because of this, the CS curriculum includes the supporting courses around that - such as data structures, algorithms, etc.  IT/IS concentrates more on how to effectively leverage the use of these programs in a business environment.  </p>
<p>In my case, the programming portion was covered in two Java courses, as well as a course covering of web development languages (JS, PHP, etc).  However, the reasoning behind the Java courses was more to understand it decently enough to manage teams of programmers.  It definitely didn't get into hardcore algorithms or anything.  </p>
<p>In IS/IT, a lot of emphasis is placed on developing a curriculum that can bridge the gap between business and programming.  Executives understand business well, but they often don't understand programming.  At the same time, software developers may not be in a position to understand business requirements.  One aspect of IT, systems analysis, focuses on studying how a business operates, transforming that into a logical model, then using that as a starting point for a software development project.</p>
<p>If you're interested the scope of my curriculum involved topics (in order of depth of coverage):</p>
<ul>
<li>Systems Analysis and Design </li>
<li>Database Architecture/Administration</li>
<li>Network Architecture </li>
<li>Information Security </li>
<li>Project Management </li>
<li>Programming </li>
<li>Information Storage</li>
</ul>
<p>Lower level courses (100/200) tended to be more similar to the pre-req's that a business major would need (Accounting, Economics, Law + plus various basic reqs).

It also suggests something deeper about the interplay between them. Brute force can make a problem trivial that is analytically fairly difficult but brute force solutions are slower by orders of magnitude than the solutions that we come up with analytically. </p>
<p>In robotics, brute force approaches make possible formulations that aren't analytically tractable such as arbitrary distribution shapes. Yet analytical insight enables us to formulate versions of those algorithms that are vastly more efficient than brute force. Consider the Kalman Filter, it's an analytical solution but to a problem that's often the wrong one. When we generalize it, we're left with an integral of an arbitrary function that we can't solve. So we can approach it by brute force using a histogram filter but that becomes slow at high enough resolution with enough dimensions. If we shift to analyzing where the computation is occurring, we see that much of it is in low probability regions.

<p>This is what I wish I knew the first day of class.</p>
<p>•   <strong>Programming requires active learning</strong>. If you are a successful passive learner that will help, but you still need to get your hands dirty if you want to learn how to code. That is why Dave continually challenges you with quizzes. Take his problems, alter them and rework them. To learn a new procedure, try to apply it in various ways. As you work more problems, you will start to see when and where you can apply the tools that you are learning.</p>
<p>•   <strong>Keep a list of the procedures, processes, and commands as they are introduced</strong>. This will help you to reduce time searching PDF files and reviewing videos.  </p>
<p>•   <strong>The best place to test your code is at this <a href=""http://people.csail.mit.edu/pgbovine/python/tutor.html#mode=visualize"" rel=""nofollow"">python tutorial site</a></strong>.  It allows you to step thru your code and see how the computer executes it. The site also has examples of coding procedures/commands that you can run.  The only limitation is that it times out at 200 steps.</p>
<p>•   <strong>Experienced programmers will help you</strong>. Though there is no programming experience required to take this course, the majority of active students will have prior experience. The bad new is that they will kick your ass on the homework. The good news is that they will teach you what you have problems learning. In my class, one generous experienced programmer held weekly study groups on Google+ and another posted all his answer for one week’s homework with his explanations of how he addressed the problems.</p>
<p>•   <strong>Use the discussion forum</strong>. If you need help, post your questions on the discussion forum. If you think the answer you get is inadequate or you did not understand the comment, follow-up with additional questions in the same thread. </p>
<p>•   <strong>Programming can be frustrating – don’t take it personally</strong>. You will get error messages for a variety of reasons. Over time you will get better at finding the cause and learning techniques and practices that help reduce errors. But if you cannot solve a problem, post your code on the discussion forum. The more experienced programers have made the error you just made and they are excellent at proofreading code.</p>
<p>•   <strong>Reviewing other people’s code helps you learn</strong>. There usually are many correct coding solutions for the same problem. You can learn new tools and techniques by seeing how someone else answered a question. Frequently student post their answers on the discussion forum.</p>
<p>•   <strong>Remember why you decided to take this class</strong>.  I assume you want to learn something new. You did not take this course to improve your GPA.   Most of you will find this course to be challenging and many of the experienced programmers will not. The grades compare you to them --- instead, compare you to yourself. Do you know more today than you did last week. Focus on improving your knowledge and abilities. If, on the other hand, you pick this stuff up easily, I am happy for you, please help those who are not as quick on the uptake and there really is no need for you to broadcast your success.</p>
<p>•   <strong>Partial credit really does not apply in coding</strong>.  This isn’t a history class. On one homework problem, I coded it correctly, but my procedure name was “Median” rather than “median” – yes, 100% wrong because of a capital letter. (See <em>Remember why you decided to take this class.</em>)  In this case, my answer was marked wrong because the software that was grading the homework only had “median” as an acceptable answer. But a more important point is that in the real world if you get coding 99% right – it still is wrong.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure I know where I screwed myself on this one. While playing around with it, I added an if statement that caused it to skip printing the very last result of the running factorial. I did it for cosmetic reasons because we were calling factorial() preceded by a print statement. This caused the final result to be printed twice; once as part of the running factorial, and again when the print statement printed the result. So, to make it more aesthetically pleasing, I told it not to print the last line in the running factorial calculation.Oops. However, I believe that the actual cache code works properly. You can't really tell by speed because calculating factorial is so fast that you need to give it a huge number to make it take any time, then you run into memory issues. I was using factorial2() to see how high you'd need to go to see any difference. </p>
<p>On another note, the recursive fibonacci procedure is interesting, but it doesn't use the cache.</p>

<pre><code>#[Double Gold Star] Memoization is a way to make code run faster by saving
#previously computed results.  Instead of needing to recompute the value of an
#expression, a memorized computation first looks for the value in a cache of pre-
#computed values.

#Define a procedure, cached_execution(cache, code), that takes in two inputs: a
#cache, which is a Dictionary that maps strings representing Python expressions
#to their previously computed values, and code, a string that is a Python
#expression.  Your procedure should return the value of code, but should only
#evaluate code if it has not been previously evaluated.

<p>I took a class several years back in educational testing to determine success / failure of various methodologies and/or resources.  The assumption was that if 50 of 100 students in the trials typically made a ""C"" (or whatever the grading standard was on the final test, when a given course of study involved testing at the end), and the remaining students fell on a symmetrical bell curve, then the unit / course / whatever would prove to be statistically fair for all students in the same categories as the tested students.  Follow up testing (typically over the course of several years) was expected to show the same trends.  Unfortunately, we were given the statistical outcome for the various studies, but teaching us how to run the statistics ourselves was not part of the course, so I can't explain the outcomes mathematically.  The primary reason I'm taking this course, is because I felt and continue to feel that just being given numbers without the understanding of how those numbers were generated didn't really teach me anything about the validity of educational testing.  I have at various times been somewhat to highly challenged by this course, but am really glad to finally have the opportunity to fill out my knowledge so that I can, hopefully, eventually understand how the data we studied in the education class was created, and consequently be able to determine for myself whether or not those studies were valid. :-) </p>"	"comment"	"10009599"	"10009557"	"2012-07-30 01:44:04.42575+00"	"0"	""	"\N"	"100017178"	"2012-10-25 05:38:23.262053+00"	"10013603"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

(the released valgrind doesn't handle MacOSX applications well, although saw some posts that they may have some of the bugs fixed in the SVN repository)</p>
<p>Anyways, I tested on a MacSPICE, a MacOSX CAD program for circuit simulation.  I used the sample libraries provided with the program as my starting point, and fuzzed per the Charlie Miller / class video.  The program didn't like the normal unix path I was feeding it, so I needed to move the fuzzed file to an application-specific directory first, and then launch the program with the source file as an argument.  I added a very minor bit of logging to save the files that caused crashes:</p>
<pre><code>num_crashes = 0
...
process = subprocess.Popen([app,fuzz_output])
time.sleep(1)
crashed = process.poll()
if not crashed:
    process.terminate()
else:
    num_crashes = num_crashes + 1
    print ""Crash# "" + str(num_crashes) + "" for fuzzed file "" + file_choice
    log_crash_fname = ""crashed_fuzzfile_"" + str(num_crashes) + "".cir""
    open(log_crash_fname,'wb').write(buf)
</code></pre>
<p>After ~2k iterations, I'd had 5 crashes due to invalid memory execution attempts.  These were being caused by corruption of some arguments to some of the SPICE deck commands:</p>
<pre><code>* Normal line:
.disto dec 20 1.0e3 1.0e8 0.9

* Corrupted line:
.disto dec 20 1.0e3 1.0N8 0.9
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Update:</strong><br>
I had sent one of these bugs to the developer, and just got a nice note back indicating that he had found and fixed the cause of the crash.  And then he invited me to send any other bugs found (while also warning about the ability to construct and execute shell commands with certain inputs).   I did feel a bit guilty about sending the bug back to him, as in the scheme of things, crashing from an invalid input isn't as big of a deal for this type of program as, say, not running a valid analysis or giving an incorrect result.  I have really appreciated his ongoing development effort of this tool over the years (most non-commercial SPICE tools don't get too far from the crusty university code).  So, <em>cheapeau!!!</em> </p>

The OP is not suggesting that everyone should be considering TDD, but asking how those of us with development knowledge and some knowledge of Python might use CS101 as a vehicle to help us practice TDD using Python.</p>
<p>Obviously not all questions are suited to TDD but I have tried to use it where possible. Below is the test code I wrote for HW 2.6. I initially used assert statements like this.</p>
<pre><code>assert find_last('aaaa', 'a') == 3
assert find_last('', 'a') == -1
assert find_last('', '') == 0
assert find_last('aaaa', '') == 4
assert find_last('aaaa', 'aa') == 2
assert find_last('aaaa', 'aaa') == 1
assert find_last('aaaa', 'aaaa') == 0
assert find_last('aaaa', 'aaaaa') == -1
assert find_last('How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?', 'wood') == 65
assert find_last('aAa', 'aa') == -1
assert find_last('It works fine for me too', '') == len('It works fine for me too')
print 'Tests pass'
</code></pre>
<p>This relies on the assert statement raising an exception that stops execution but has the downside of not running all tests and not indicating which test failed, so I refined it to this.</p>
<pre><code>def test(search, target, expected_result):
    actual_result = find_last(search, target)
    if actual_result == expected_result:
        return True
    print ""find_last('"" + search + ""', '"" + target + ""'): actual ="", actual_result, "", expected = "", expected_result
    return False

success = test('aaaa', 'a', 3)
success = success and test('', 'a', -1)
success = success and test('', '', 0)
success = success and test('aaaa', '', 4)
success = success and test('aaaa', 'aa', 2)
success = success and test('aaaa', 'aaa', 1)
success = success and test('aaaa', 'aaaa', 0)
success = success and test('aaaa', 'aaaaa', -1)
success = success and test('How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?', 'wood', 65)
success = success and test('aAa', 'aa', -1)
success = success and test('It works fine for me too', '', len('It works fine for me too'))

if success:
    print 'All tests pass'
</code></pre>
<p>So now it will print a message for all failing tests, showing the input values along with expected and actual results. If all tests pass a message is printed indicating this.</p>
<p>I'm sure there must be information and or libraries on the web to to provide guidance or help with TDD in Python and I plan to investigate this. I'll add any useful info I find to this question.</p>"	"answer"	"4402"	"4402"	"2012-03-06 05:53:36.905541+00"	"2"	""	"\N"	"100003350"	"2012-03-13 10:21:22.734604+00"	"27487"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

Make ppl learn how to implement basic data structures, how to structure data , how to chose more advanced data structures sensibly, how to build custom structure on those primitives, teach data structure starting from CS 101, and slowly build to something like 212, which is an outstanding course, and you will create much better programmers IMO.</p>"	"comment"	"2018096"	"2018014"	"2012-07-29 17:46:15.402315+00"	"1"	""	"2186399"	"100037743"	"2012-07-29 17:56:25.80395+00"	"2025258"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>This function contains two loops and both of them will visit each element of input list <code>p</code> exactly once. First, all elements will be compared to the first one, then all elements will be compared to the second one, etc. etc. until all elements will be compared with the last one. We are here speaking about the worst case, naturally. In other case, it may happen that the first and second element might be the same, which will end the function and return true almost immediately. But that is not the point. Regarding complexities, you are always (well, not really, but almost - average case is also important sometimes) thinking about the worst case. And this function has quadratic complexity, i.e. <code>O(n^2)</code>.</p>

It even stays true in the best case, when all those values are divisible by <code>2</code>, its complexity will just not go up so fast (i.e. <code>1/2 O(n)</code>), but that is linear function as well (and constants like that <code>1/2</code> are being neglected, when speaking about complexities, anyway).</p>

<p><strong>HW5.2: Hash String</strong></p>
<p><em>Statement #1</em></p>
<pre><code>The number of string comparisons done to lookup a keyword that is not a key in the hash table may be less than the number needed to lookup a keyword that is a key in the hash table.
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>This one is true. Just imagine a keyword, which is not in a hash table, but if it was, it would belong to the bucket, which is currently empty. Result of looking up such non-existent keyword is produced without even one string comparison. Opposing example to this would be a keyword present in a hash table, stored on last position in a bucket, which contains other 200 (in fact, just one is enough to make that statement true) keywords.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Statement #2</em></p>
<pre><code>We should expect the time to lookup most keywords in the hash table will decrease as we increase the number of buckets.
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>We should indeed expect that. If we have just one bucket, all keywords go into it, which will effectively make our ""one-bucket-hash-table"" behave like a list, with linear complexity. In case of two buckets, the average lookup time will be halved. In theory, such ""two-bucket-hash-table"" might end up with all keywords, except only one, being stored in one bucket and just one in the other bucket. Looking up such keyword would require constant time as opposed to linear time, which would be needed in ""one-bucket-hash-table"". Such case as described here is indeed highly unprobable, but not impossible and the question says <strong>we should</strong> not <strong>we always must</strong>.</p>
<p>Anyway, it will not be as unprobable with ""normal"" hash tables, containing at least several buckets and in general, the more buckets the hash table has, it becomes more easier to spread all keywords in such a way that each bucket will contain at most one of them, which makes lookup faster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Statement #3</em></p>
<pre><code>It is always better to have more buckets in a hash table.
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, it might seem so, but it is not entirely correct. I was tempted to say it is correct, because I was not sure whether also such things should be taken into account, but this question says <strong>always</strong>, not <strong>most of the time</strong> or something similar. The truth is, that when you take everything (e.g. also memory limitations) into account, this statement can not hold. Just try to think about it this way: In case it is <strong>always</strong> better to have more buckets in a hash table, the best hash table will have infinite number of buckets. Given that each bucket occupies at least some space, you will need really huge memory/harddrive/whatever in order to put it there (not speaking about swapping, locality of reference etc.).</p>
<p>Matter of fact, best hash table is such one, which has exactly the same number of buckets as keywords stored. This is obviously not possible in practice though. In case I remember correctly (I might be wrong, it is long time since I was looking at these things), hash table is (statistically) able to spread stored keywords very well (i.e. without too many conflicts, which means too many keywords in the same bucket) in case it is cca 95% full (i.e. <code>&lt;keywords&gt; / &lt;buckets&gt; = 0.95</code>). 95% is unbelievably high number, but it is true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Statement #4</em></p>
<pre><code>The time to lookup a keyword in the hash table is always less than the time it would take in a linear time list (as used in Unit 4).
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost all of the time, including worst case, it is true. But not always. Just imagine list, with the keyword you are searching for right at its beginning (i.e. first position) and compare that case to hash table containing your keyword in a bucket together with other 200 keywords and, even worse, your keyword being at the last position in that bucket. Improbable, but not impossible - statement #4 is wrong.</p>

<p><strong>HW5.3 Is Offered</strong></p>
<pre><code>def is_offered(courses, course, hexamester):
  return course in courses[hexamester]
</code></pre>
<p>This is nice one-liner. It is, of course, also possible to write it e.g. like this:</p>
<pre><code>def is_offered(courses, course, hexamester):
  if course in courses[hexamester]:
    return True
  else:
    return False
</code></pre>
<p>It is the same thing, just on more lines and arguably more readable for some. It just checks whether the course is present in given hexamester and returns appropriate boolean value.</p>
<p>See also <a href=""http://www.udacity-forums.com/cs101/questions/49638/homework-53-issue"" rel=""nofollow"">this post</a> by <a href=""http://forums.udacity.com/users/100005361/peterudacity"">@PeterUdacity</a> about issues regarding this assignment.</p>
<p><strong>HW5.4 When Offered</strong></p>
<pre><code>def when_offered(courses,course):
  # define the future result:
  # we are supposed to return a list so let's initialize it to empty list
  res = []
  # go through hexemesters
  for hs in courses:
    # check if the course is present in given hexemester
    if course in courses[hs]:
      # the only slightly tricky part: do not add the same hexemester twice
      if hs not in res:
        # append hexemester to the result
        res.append(hs)
  # return result after going through all hexemesters and all its courses
  return res
</code></pre>
<p>Not as easy as previous one, but still pretty straightforward. The most difficult thing on whole this series (3,4 and 5) is to make sense of the dictionary's structure. In fact, I hope you would almost never use such a huge dictionary in dictionary in dictionary ( am I the only one being reminded of Frank Herbert? :) ) in real practice (please correct me if I am wrong, because I am no Python guru, but I would give fair share of arguments to support this statement of mine). There are things like <code>class</code>es out there, which are designed to help you in organizing such monsters. This series are there just for pedagogical purposes, I think, in order to exercise working with dictionaries (not to give some best-practices example).</p>
<p><strong>HW5.5: Hash String</strong></p>
<pre><code>def involved(courses, person):
  # define the future result:
  # we are supposed to return a dictionary this time so let's initialize it to empty dictionary
  res = {}

  # traverse all hexemesters
  for hs in courses:

    # traverse all courses in each hexemester
    for c in courses[hs]:

      # traverse all attributes in each course
      for attr in courses[hs][c]:

        # if the value of attribute equals to name of searched for person
        # let's append it to the result
        if courses[hs][c][attr] == person:

          # but first make sure that there is a list to append to
          if not hs in res:
            res[hs] = []
          # when we are sure, we can proceed with append itself
          res[hs].append(c)

  # and finally return result after going through whole input dictionary
  return res
</code></pre>
<p>And the very same thing again, just slightly more difficult. Actually, the only difference (in difficulty I mean) between this and the previous one is that this one needs more loops. ""The tricky"" part of adding the key into dictionary in case it does not exist is the same as in previous assignment, just the other way around - we need to add it, in case it does not exist instead of not adding it twice.</p>
<p><strong>HW5.6: Refactoring</strong></p>
<pre><code># new function:
def hashtable_get_entry(htable, key):
    bucket = hashtable_get_bucket(htable, key)
    for entry in bucket:
        if entry[0] == key:
          return entry
    return None

# original function:
#def hashtable_update(htable, key, value):
    #bucket = hashtable_get_bucket(htable, key)
    #for entry in bucket:
        #if entry[0] == key:
            #entry[1] = value
            #return
    #bucket.append([key, value])

# refactored function:
def hashtable_update(htable, key, value):
    entry = hashtable_get_entry(htable, key)
    if entry != None:
        entry[1] = value
        return
    hashtable_get_bucket(htable, key).append([key, value])

# original function:    
#def hashtable_lookup(htable, key):
    #bucket = hashtable_get_bucket(htable, key)
    #for entry in bucket:
        #if entry[0] == key:
            #return entry[1]
    #return None

# refactored function:
def hashtable_lookup(htable, key):
    entry = hashtable_get_entry(htable, key)
    if entry != None:
      return entry[1]
    return None
</code></pre>
<p>This is what you will do for a great deal of time in case you will do dome serious programming after finishing this course. Without refactoring, your code would get uglier and uglier (especially when you are not the only one, who is modifying it) very fast until the point, when it would get unreadable, unmaintainable, unusable and worthless. That is why refactoring is very important part of programmer's job.</p>
<p>What was done here is very simple. Duplicated piece of code was identified (as part of assignment), you were then supposed to move this code to the newly created function and call that function at the original place of the code. Done - as easy as that. However, at least in real world, always make sure you do not actually break the code by refactoring (customers tend to be unhappy to pay you salary for the same visible result, which just contains more bugs). Ideally, you should have <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_test"" rel=""nofollow"">unit tests</a> in place and run them for each small change you do to the code.</p>
<p>One more comment regarding my solution: It would probably be a good idea to make the new function return both element and bucket, because <code>hashtable_update</code> is calling <code>hashtable_get_bucket</code> twice. Once as part of hashtable_get_entry and second time directly on the last line. This idea is arguable, though, since it does not influence complexity very much (<code>hashtable_get_bucket</code> is of <code>O(1)</code>, i.e. constant time function, so we are really speaking about micro-optimization here) and makes the code slightly harder to read (at least I feel like that).</p>
<p><strong>HW5.7: Hash String</strong></p>
<pre><code>def cached_execution(cache,code):
  if code in cache:
    return cache[code]
  else:
    res = eval(code)
    cache[code] = res
    return res
</code></pre>
<p>Just look into cache to see whether the code caller is asking for is already there and based on your findings either return already known result or execute the code, store the result and return it. This is very simple demonstration of how cache works like. However, it is missing several important points:<br>
 - Computer's memory is not unlimited. Because of that, it is impossible to hold all results in the cache forever. There must be some means of removing least needed (whatever that means - e.g. last accessed, least accessed, etc.) records from the cache. Otherwise it will only grow and grow, until it will be impossible to hold it in the memory/harddrive/whatever.<br>
 - Results for the same request may change in time. This probably does not apply to this particular cache, but it indeed does apply to (almost all or even really) all real-world ones. Therefore, we need some means of <em>invalidating</em> records in cache. E.g. your browser may cache web pages you visit most frequently, but those pages always tell your browser (by means of HTTP protocol), how often they need to be really refreshed from the original server instead of using browser's cache.</p>"	"question"	"\N"	"\N"	"2012-03-27 23:59:43.078869+00"	"10"	""	"157748"	"100003947"	"2012-03-28 03:01:11.090197+00"	"65672"	"\N"	"\N"	"622"	"f"

<p>Are you sure about that? You are saying that we calculate the variance in the normal fashion (sum up the squared differences from the mean and divide by the number of samples) and then divide by another n factor? I am struggling mightily with some of these concepts and this statement has just set me back quite a bit!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He gets the variances of wˉB and wˉA by squaring their given population standard deviation estimates and dividing by the sample sizes. That follows from the central limit theorem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, same question.  I know we calculate the CI by dividing by N and taking the square root, but are you saying that the variance is calculated by squaring sigma and then dividing by N again?</p>
<p>So to put this example into numbers, for PS5-5 the standard deviation is 10.  If we convert this as you say into a sample variance we get 100/10000 = .01.  If we use the normal formula for variance we get 10*10 which is 100.  So you are telling me that the sample variance is .01 but the population variance is 100?</p>
<p>I don't think he threw in a red herring when he said standard deviations add.  He said we have to add them.  It doesn't necessarily follow that he means simply taking the two numbers and adding them together.  It's like saying we have to add 3x^2 + 3x.  I wouldn't claim this is 6x^2 but yet you can still add these two terms together if you know x.</p>"	"comment"	"10009474"	"10009429"	"2012-07-29 16:18:31.493962+00"	"1"	""	"10112576"	"100002126"	"2012-07-29 16:19:20.407993+00"	"10013510"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

"51809"	"Programming as a profession"	"cs101 profession job programming"	"100005415"	"<p>The teaching of programming has, more or less, been about the same for decades, at least, in terms of content.  CS 101 is trying to teach the basics (which isn't easy) of what a language like Python can do.  This includes <strong>control flow</strong> (if, for, procedure calls), things that hold data (variables, lists, dictionaries) often called <strong>data structures</strong>, and how to make code do things--at its purest, this is <strong>algorithms</strong> (something is called an <strong>algorithm</strong> if it solves a mathematically well-defined program).</p>
<p>However, that's the tip of the iceberg.  It's the central part of programming.  If you don't know this, then it's hard to do anything else.</p>
<p>Since Java was introduced, libraries have become huge in programming.  Until then, some programmers had NIH (Not Invented Here) Syndrome which meant, if they didn't write the code, they didn't use the code.  This stemmed from computer science education not teaching people how to read other people's code (good or bad).  These days, so much has been done in libraries by experienced programmers that writing your own version would produce one that's probably buggier and has fewer features than the libraries.</p>
<p>The next part is collaboration.  Programmers have need to collaborate since programming began, but this is more important than ever.  Thus, programmers have to deal with multiple people handling the same code and how to resolve and communicate with one another.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>version control</strong> (software that tracks each saved version of your code, and allows you to create different ""versions"" by a process called branching, and allows you to ""tag"", i.e., give a name to a snapshot of the files you have at a specific point in time).  This is a skill that's beyond programming. (Common examples: Subversion, Git, Perforce)</li>
<li><strong>bug tracking software</strong> This is now extended to ""issue tracking"" and can be used to keep track of the progress of code development.  (Common examples: Bugzilla, JIRA)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, software design needs to be planned and adjust to changes.  This is the whole <em>software development cycle</em>.  The old way that was used (and still is used) is called <em>the waterfall model</em>.  It divided software development into a few phases.  The first is requirements analysis (what does the customer want).  Then decisions on what classes and functionality to support.  This would often be spelled out in great detail.  Then implementation, testing, and acceptance with testing and implementation potentially cycling, and occasionally certain design decisions being revisited.</p>
<p>These days, there's also agile software development that starts with a minimal feature set, emphasizes fast iterations (creating small features every 2-4 weeks) and getting customer feedback.</p>
<p>Then, because people care about saving their data (""persisting it"") and doing things on the Web, some programmers must learn ""web application stacks"" that include a language (like Java), a database (like Oracle), and ways for code to talk to database.  This can involve several other technologies.</p>
<p>Then, there's testing.  How do you test your code?  There are unit tests to test the smaller aspects of the code.  There's functional testing.  People need to test web pages (Selenium is popular).</p>
<p>There's code organization.  So far, you've worked with one file.  What if there are hundreds of files?  How do you manage this?  You start creating folders, but do you come up with your own scheme or follow a standard scheme used in the industry.</p>
<p>You may need to know about build tools that build your software.  You may need software to deploy your software.  You may want continuous integration that checks any commits for errors and lets you know very quickly that something bad has happened.</p>
<p>And you have to keep an eye out on developing trends in software, lest the industry move some place and you're not aware of it.</p>
<p>CS 101 is like pure essential programming.  I liken it to running a restaurant.  The essence of running a restaurant is cooking.  But there's a lot more to it than that.  In particular, there's getting food, organizing the kitchen, establishing roles in the kitchen, creating the menu, pricing the menu, how to handle guests, etc.  There's a lot more to running a restaurant effectively than merely cooking.  Similarly, there's more to developing software than just programming.</p>"	"question"	"\N"	"\N"	"2012-03-30 14:49:09.763982+00"	"8"	""	"\N"	"100008283"	"2012-03-30 18:13:26.149878+00"	"68575"	"\N"	"\N"	"284"	"f"

<p>Remember that the mean is simply the average value. After a large number of flips, the mean will approach the probability,</p>
<p>The 0 and 1 part is just one way to represent a binomial (2 outcome) experiment, quite useful for programming. Say you flip 10 coins, 5 heads 5 tails. 5 * 0 = 0 for tails, 5 * 1 = 5 for heads. The sum of them is 5, divided by the amount of flips which is 10, making it a .5 mean. </p>
<p>In this example, 11th flip will cause it to be (6 heads, 5 tails) or (6 heads, 5 tails), which would result in a mean of .545 or .455.</p>
<p>If, however, you had 100 flips which ended up being equal to the proabbility (50 heads 50 tails and a mean of .5), the 101st flip would result in 51 heads 50 tails or 50 heads 51 tails, or a mean of .51 or .49 depending on if the 101st flip was a heads or tails.</p>
<p>The point is fairly simple with confidence intervals, the more trials (N) you take, the more confident you will be that the mean will fall close to the probability. It's really quite amazing when you get deep into the theory, and has a lot of applications. It's difficult to grasp at first, but keep it up! It's a great way to train your brain and learn something of use. If you still are confused about why he's using 0 and 1 for tails and heads, I could try explaining it a different way.</p>"	"comment"	"10009557"	"10009557"	"2012-07-29 16:17:27.021794+00"	"1"	""	"10112579"	"100039045"	"2012-07-29 16:23:29.713364+00"	"10013511"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

The lack of driver solves one of those problems directly. The positioning loss will be solved in part through higher utilization and in part through far more sophisticated positioning algorithms. </p>
<p>The other argument you could raise is that people don't like taxis. Some of the reasons include uncertainty about the experience, lack of privacy, potential safety risks. All of those are eliminated by the self-driving taxi.</p>
<p>I'm sure many people will have a similar negative reaction initially but over time it will come to be seen as normal and the advantages will outweigh your fear. Consider how restrictive it is to always have to use the same car regardless of what you're doing. How inefficient is it that you manage repairing and temporarily replacing your car due to mechanical defects?  </p>
<p>I think this risk is far enough down the road that it receives little consideration at car companies. Regardless, in a competitive market, rational companies invest in things that cause reduced profitability as long as the innovation reduces profitability less if you also have it.

<p>I ran it twice - once for two hours &amp; then for six hours.</p>
<p>The first time it returned a list of <strong>358105</strong> numbers, with the largest being a mammoth <strong>366</strong> digits at <strong>~5.56*10<sup>365</sup></strong>! The file was almost 51mb in size, with <strong>10754</strong> pages in open office at a font size of 10 - it wouldn't open in gedit.</p>
<p>The second time around I let it run for six hours &amp; got a list of <strong>589089</strong> numbers, in a file of size over <strong>122mb</strong> and <strong>25841</strong> pages, with the largest number being <strong>522</strong> digits long at <strong>~7.15*10<sup>521</sup></strong>.</p>
<p>I had my jaw drop to the floor when I got these results.</p>
<p>Wow, just wow! Also, kudos to Python for handling such huge numbers like a champ.</p>
<p>PS - Sadly, this program doesn't cover all the numbers between 1 &amp; largest. It has gaps, a lot of gaps in between because it starts the next iteration of the main loop with the <code>current largest + 1</code></p>
<p>If anyone is interested I have blogged about this <a href=""http://blog.justarandomguy.com/2012/03/collatz-madness.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, though I think this post is much better than the blog post. Also, if you want to download the code, it's available on <a href=""http://codepad.co/s/63bdbb"" rel=""nofollow"">code pad</a></p>
<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>Wrote another program, this one makes a graph of all numbers between 1 &amp; n(and some more) using a python dictionary and each entry in the dictionary has a list, with the first element the next number in the cycle &amp; the second element the length of the cycle.</p>
<pre><code>

#!/usr/bin/python

# Program to calculate the Collatz of each number from 1 to n

import math
import time

def collatz(n, cg):
    if n in cg:
        return
    if math.log(n, 2)==int(math.log(n, 2)):
        cg[n]= [int(2**(math.log(n,2)-1)), int(math.log(n, 2))]
        collatz(2**(math.log(n,2)-1), cg)
        return
    else:
        if n%2:
            c= 3*n+1
        else:
            c= n/2
        collatz(c, cg)
        cg[n]= [c, cg[c][4]+1]
        return

def calc_cycle(n):
    collatz_graph= {1: [None, 0]}
    for i in range(2,n+1):
        if i not in collatz_graph:
            collatz(i, collatz_graph)
    return collatz_graph

Is that explicitly stated in the question typically?</p>
<p>I would say that this should be stated or at least implied in a given problem situation.  For example if we are asked to determine if a new teaching method makes a difference in student achievement (as measured by final exam scores) I would use a two-tailed test, since we  are given no indication if the new method will contribute to an increase or decrease in students' scores.</p>
<p>In another situation,  to determine if a certain exercise program is helping participants lose weight, we would set the hyp. test as a one tailed test.  The Null could  be that the program does not work or that the average participant will not lose any weight, i.e. $% \mu =0 $%  The alternate could be that $% \mu &lt;0 $%  or that the avg. participant will lose weight.  (Assuming a negative value represents a loss.)</p>
<p>In general, if the problem just asks something like ""Is there a difference in ....... ,"" then I'd say that we need a two-tailed test.  If the question spefically asks if there is a decrease in cholesterol level or if there is an increase in memory retention etc, we need to use a one-tailed test.</p>"	"comment"	"10009176"	"10009171"	"2012-07-29 04:48:11.952279+00"	"0"	""	"\N"	"100064408"	"2012-07-29 04:48:11.952279+00"	"10013408"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

So if we take 1 as the scale parameter, y[i]+x[i]-y[i]=x[i]. Similarly y[i]+y[i+1]+y[i-1]-2*y[i] sets y[i] to something analogous to the average of the previous and subsequent observations. The weighting between these determines the weighting of the two objective functions. Note that if it weren't for the complication of omitting end points, the second iteration could be simplified to just consider the lagging observation.

As you note, after one move there's only a 10% chance it didn't move and hence a 0.1 probability of it being there. The probability of it not moving on its second move is also 10%, which yields a 0.01 (0.1 x 0.1) chance of being in its initial cell after two moves.</p>
<p>Now moving back to the first cell, we see it has the same probability. The reason is that to get there requires two moves of 2: To cell 4 and then wrapping to cell 1. There is no other sequence of moves that will work. The probability of a move of 2 is the same as that of 0 so the answer is the same: 0.1*0.1=0.01.</p>
<p>Now let's consider the most likely case of cell 4. It can arrive there by either moving 2 and then 0, 0 and then 2 or 1 and then 1. So the chance of it happening is the chance of any of those move orders which is their sum. The probability of a move of 2 and then 0 is only 0.01 because each of those moves has a 0.1 probability. The probability of a move of 0 and 2 is the same. The probability of moving 1 each of two times however is the probability of moving 1 (0.8) time the probability of moving 1 again (0.8) which is 0.64. So the total probability is 0.64+0.01+0.01=0.66.</p>

When couldn't you? Imagine that every possible move error has a meaningful non-zero probability. You would need the complete prior matrix for each update in such a case. </p>
<p>In practice, this isn't an issue because the full matrix wouldn't be stored. We normally have a decent idea of where the robot is which means most states have nearly zero probability. If we round that nearly zero probability to zero, we can use sparse matrices while losing little information. Similarly, in a particle filter one needs far fewer particles than the number of states for a sufficiently large system with a decently localized robot. </p>
<p>If you really wanted to save memory while computing a full matrix, the first step would likely be to store the deltas in a separate matrix which could use a more compact type. If you then wanted to implement in place copying to save even more memory, you could modify that algorithm to commit the differentials after verifying that no further cells depend on a previously computed value.</p>"	"answer"	"1002837"	"1002837"	"2012-02-24 20:28:48.158553+00"	"4"	""	"1012149"	"100027424"	"2012-02-24 20:48:04.347231+00"	"1003937"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

"1002249"	""	"cs373 "	"100027424"	"<p>First we need to figure out what we mean by a method. Generally, a method in this space can be thought of as some combination of assumptions about the world, available data, and heuristics and approximations employed in the solution. Markov refers to the first piece. It is the assumption that our current state contains all information. Assumptions about the world also includes more specific things like the number of dimensions and continuity or discreteness. Our available information was color and motion feedback. Since the problem was so simple, we computed it exactly. </p>
<p>By this definition, in the lecture we implemented  a 1-D color/motion exact markov localization algorithm. In the homework, we're implementing a 2-D version. Of course, since they're so similar and it's possible to implement the algorithm so that the number of dimensions is arbitrary, it's often classified as a single algorithm.</p>
<p>I'm sure I'll miss many but to give you some idea for the range of algorithms, I'll give some examples. I believe all algorithms are fundamentally Markovian since given the right state variables, that's a reasonable assumption. The world can be either continuous or discrete as we'll see next week. The vast majority of what I suspect most will call methods for localization are really computational approaches to handling continuity. In a continuous world, we have to make either strong assumptions about errors to facilitate exact computation or approximate. The histogram is an example of approximation by partitioning a continuous space often into a grid. Another common approximation is the particle filter which is based on sampling from a probability distribution and continuing the calculation for each sample point instead of each partition while resampling as an efficient means of convolution. Within each of these methods, there are many more sub-methods based on implementation questions like grid density, resampling adjustments and the like. On the more analytic side, the most basic example is the Kalman filter which assumes that the uncertainty is normally distributed. There are many extensions to it that attempt to compensate for the error of that assumption such as the extended Kalman filter which provides a first order adjustment for non-linearity. </p>
<p>One other assumption we've made in all of these localization algorithms is that they're forward pass. That is we only care about our position at the moment we're there. We could broaden our class of algorithms if we were interested in obtaining the most accurate path of the robot at each point to include those that update all past localizations at each point or as needed.</p>"	"answer"	"1002230"	"1002230"	"2012-02-24 03:32:51.503874+00"	"0"	""	"\N"	"100027424"	"2012-02-24 03:32:51.503874+00"	"1003034"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

Therefore, I believe the car uses the particle filter in practice which like the histogram filter handles arbitrary distributions but is more efficient.</p>"	"answer"	"1011597"	"1011597"	"2012-03-04 02:07:19.396778+00"	"1"	"(accepted)"	"\N"	"100027424"	"2012-03-04 02:07:19.396778+00"	"1015906"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"t"

I am following the procedure that Sebastian was demonstrating - first get the actual variance of the individual scores, then the variance of the means (which he says is equal to sigma^2 / N^2), then the standard deviation of the means (which then gets equal to sigma / N) and then we multiply this standard deviation with 1,96 (the z-value). Therefore, the formula for the confidence intervals actually becomes: </p>
<p>CI = mu +- z * sigma / N : which is the same as: mu +- z * square root of (sigma^2 / N^2)</p>
<p>This is also different from what I know for confidence intervals, but maybe the difference is that in the case above we know the true population mean and variance, and we are looking for a confidence interval for the sample means, and NOT the other way around. That is what I am trying to find out, why do we have N^2 and not N in this formula.

If m0 is your last doable one, then you have already figured out that pow and using double asterisks for exponentiation are not adequate when using big numbers, especially when using pow and a fractional exponent.  iroot from the gmpy2 library works to get a particular root of a number.  Use the mod_exp function from class instead of **.</p>
<p>Yep, there is so much information in this thread it can be overwhelming.  Take your problem a step at a time.  Do you know your factorization function is working properly?  Test it out with smaller numbers than n0.  Did you get factors for n0?  If so, make sure they are right by multiplying the factors together and checking that the result is n0.  </p>
<p>Once you get factors of n0 you can compute d0.

<li>
<p>If you want to overwrite the existing page, make sure you can uniquely retrieve the old wiki page from the datastore. I did this by storing the URL as part of the WikiPage object. Then retrieve it, e.g. via <code>wiki = db.GqlQuery('SELECT * FROM WikiPage WHERE url=:1 LIMIT 1', link_.get())</code>, update it, .put() it back.</p>

<li>
<p>If you are wanting to also implement the history (i.e. the second question), you need to do something else. You either need to store a diff (as in, the difference between the versions) or, much more easily, store the new page as a separate entity (URL is not unique). Then if you have to retrieve the latest WikiPage, just update the previous query to something like: <code>wiki = db.GqlQuery('SELECT * FROM WikiPage WHERE url=:1 ORDER BY created DESC LIMIT 1', link_.get())</code>.</p>

<p>Whether it's better to move some people from very little knowledge to some knowledge or fewer people from significant knowledge to even more knowledge is debatable based on both specific parameters and the future actions the participants take. The real solution is to build courses at a variety of levels or better yet make them adaptive to the level of the student. This requires both more content and a structure and algorithm for deploying content. This is certainly feasible and given that this is a company founded by someone with an AI background, I assume this will be done. However, it seems their initial goal is to build for widest consumption and broaden content before optimizing instruction based on prior knowledge and aptitude. </p>

<p>You're right that the Kalman filter doesn't fix the diversity problem but neither does the particle filter once it's been localized.

<p>As for your own coding practice, with experience you will learn to choose loop structures that are tight and efficient for each specific task.  If you need to execute a loop at most a specific number of times, use a counter and either count up or count down.  In many languages this is called a for loop or a do loop, whereas Python apparently uses a while loop.  The ""while"" construct can also be used to test a logical stopping criterion.  (I've used a language that also offers an ""until"" construct for this.  Until loops are sometimes guaranteed to execute at least once, but not in this language.)  The Python ""for"" control is used for stepping through a list and assigning a name to each element in turn, which is probably different from the for loops you are used to.</p>"	"answer"	"33689"	"33689"	"2012-03-13 05:47:05.99427+00"	"2"	""	"\N"	"100008230"	"2012-03-13 05:47:05.99427+00"	"44034"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

This one was a little tricky and I spent a bit of time making sure I had the dictionary structure right. However, I can't find anything that would cause it to be marked incorrect. After seeing that it was marked incorrect, I searched through the code with alternative data in mind and found a possible bug that wasn't part of the criteria for the program. In the innermost loop, I continue the loop after a person's name has been found and the course added to the list. If for some reason the person being searched was listed for two or more jobs for the same course, the course would be added to the list for each job listing. For example, if I modified the data for cs101 in 'feb2012' to the following:</p>
<pre><code>'cs101': {'name': 'Building a Search Engine',

Good advice.  I think I'll skim through the videos and take notes on the major concepts.

Here are the three biggest differences between my code and the original:  (1) He sets off two general sections of the code with comment lines, the stats functions and data structures, and the predict functions and data structures.  These fit very nicely into classes, so I just made them classes. (2) The C code relies on a lot of side-effects in his functions.  I tried to remove side effects whenever I saw them, as I think they make code harder to understand and debug.  You see this change most evident in in the do_history (I renamed match_history, sorry) and scan_predict functions.  (3) Finally, I noticed the original do_history had repetitive copy-pasted code; I tried to follow DRY principle, and called the function three times instead.</p>"	"comment"	"5014715"	"5014564"	"2012-07-27 22:52:38.983366+00"	"0"	""	"\N"	"100070102"	"2012-07-27 22:52:38.983366+00"	"5020841"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<li>Students deleted or modified the code above the comment section. This section was necessary for grading purposes. Admittedly this is not the most robust system and we will try our best to make future homework more clear about what you can modify.</li>
<li>Students redefined the show() function. While this wasn't explicitly forbidden, this had the same affect on the grading as modifying the show command. The reason you couldn't do this is because we actually redefine the show command in our grading script. This was an effort to prevent us from grading you wrong if your solution included print statements for debugging.</li>

<p>as you can see this is incorrect. The answer should be 4. When you round a number you start from the last digit and work your through the entire string of digits.</p>
<p>So that's why I took so long to solve it, cos I actually solved it and the code will work for any number decimal or float:</p>
<h1>working code</h1>
<pre><code>y = str(x)
point = y.find('.')  
plus = ''  # must declare this variable here because you cannot declare them inside loops.
if point != -1:  # if -1 then no there is no point so code will work if you put x = 32 for example, it'll just give back the same value
    while y[-2] != '.':  # must round off all the digits until only 1 digit is left after the decimal point.
        if int(y[-1]) &gt;= 5:  # i.e. if last integer greater than or equal to 5.
            if int(y[-2]) == 9:  # This was tricky. If second to last digit is 9 then it must stay the same else things get screwed up.
                plus = int(y[-2])  # as you will see below plus is a variable which holds what the last digit should be.
            else:
                plus = int(y[-2])+1
            y = y[:-2]  # remove last two digits from y before concatenating plus to the end.
            y += str(plus)  # This is a shortcut to concatenation. It's the same as y = y + str(plus)
        else:  # at this point you just have to slowly navigate through the if else branches and work it out.
            y = y[:-1]
    if int(y[-1]) &gt;= 5:
        x = int(y[:point]) + 1
    else:
        x = int(y[:point])
else:
    pass

print x
</code></pre>
<p>now try with 3.49</p>
<pre><code>x = 3.49
</code></pre>
<p>run the code<br>

"10009378"	""	"st101 "	"100008230"	"<p>Wow.  That's a good article, and helped clear my thinking.  The last paragraph is an especially helpful summary (if you also scan back to see statement T).</p>
<p><a href=""http://forums.udacity.com/users/100027923/brendan""><a href=""http://forums.udacity.com/users/100027923/brendan"">@Brendan</a></a>, you're close with your final statements, but not quite there.  On the assumption that the population mean is 52, 95% of the confidence intervals constructed from random samples will contain the value 52.  And that does provide information about the likely closeness of the sample mean and population mean, but only when considering an ensemble of samples that have each given the same estimate (52).</p>
<p>(EDIT: Have I even gotten that right?  We compute a confidence interval centered on 52 because that is our observed sample mean.  [We could, in theory, construct other confidence intervals, symmetric or non-symmetric, centered anywhere we like.  Even discontinuous intervals.]  How necessary is that sample mean in describing what the confidence interval means?)</p>
<p>Which nicely illustrates why frequentist definitions are often difficult to work with.  (Whether they are true, in some logical sense, is a separate issue.  I believe they are true -- but just as there can be non-Euclidean geometries, there can be other valid definitions of probability.)</p>
<p><a href=""http://forums.udacity.com/users/100024067/rob""><a href=""http://forums.udacity.com/users/100024067/rob"">@Rob</a></a>, I don't know that I can satisfy your curiosity about the foundational issues, but I see it as all revolving around whether unknown quantities are necessarily fixed or can be assigned probability distributions.  Given a single random sample (of size N) and a single population, a frequentist has little to say.  The sample statistics are what they are, just as the population mean is what it is.  The confidence interval either includes the population mean or it doesn't (we just don't know which).</p>
<p>To make statistical statements, the frequentist must generalize to an ensemble of such experiments.  Thus we get Sober's discussion of the procedure's statistical properties.  Carry out this procedure often enough and it will have the 95% property that we ascribe to the confidence intervals it produces.  Carry out any frequentist procedures often enough and your test conclusions will be right 95% of the time.  (Or whatever significance level you choose to use.)</p>
<p>Bayesians start from a different theoretical perspective, in which there is a prior probability distribution for the population parameter.  It might be an impulse function (which reduces to the frequentist position) or a uniform distribution, or from the Dirichlet family, or anything else reasonable in the specific problem domain.  That prior distribution propagates through the equations we use, but usually has decreasing effect as more data is gathered.  And it allows us to make statements about the probability that the true, unknown parameter value falls within some range, the credible interval.</p>"	"comment"	"10009357"	"10009034"	"2012-07-27 20:37:15.149621+00"	"1"	""	"10111134"	"100008230"	"2012-07-27 21:02:08.872587+00"	"10013211"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

Below is a summary of the historic figures mentioned so far (mostly taken from Wikipedia and the History of Computing Project)</p>
<p><strong>John Backus</strong> (1924-2007)</p>
<p>Lead designer of the programming language Fortran (Formula Translator) and developed the Backus-Naur Form notation. Awarded the Turing Award in 1977. His award lecture 'Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style? A Functional Style and Its Algebra of Programs' can be found <a href=""http://www.thocp.net/biographies/papers/backus_turingaward_lecture.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. Referenced in <a href=""http://www.udacity.com/view#Course/cs101/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/2001/Nugget/2005"" rel=""nofollow"">Unit 1 - Grammer</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Lothar Collatz</strong> (1910-1990)</p>
<p>A German mathematician who proposed the Collatz conjecture (or 3x+1 problem) in 1937. At present the conjecture remains unsolved. One part of <a href=""http://www.udacity.com/view#Course/cs101/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/137001/Nugget/149001"" rel=""nofollow"">HomeWork 2.5</a> used this conjecture as the basis of a program for which it is not currently known if it will always halt for any given positive integer. The sequence of numbers generated by this formula is know as a hailstone sequence.</p>
<p><strong>Georges Danton</strong> (1759-1794)</p>
<p>A prominent figure in the French Revolution.  Gave us a great quote to work with in the example <a href=""http://www.udacity.com/view#Course/cs101/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/2001/Nugget/1021"" rel=""nofollow"">Unit 1 - Finding with Numbers</a> <em>""il nous faut de l'audace, et encore de l'audace, et toujours de l'audace""</em>  - ""We need audacity, and yet more audacity, and always audacity!""</p>
<p><strong>Grace Hopper</strong> (1906-1992)</p>
<p>Developed the first compiler for a programming language and influenced the design of COBOL (COmmon Business-Oriented Language). Referenced in <a href=""http://www.udacity.com/view#Course/cs101/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/2001/Nugget/1006"" rel=""nofollow"">Unit 1 - Grace Hopper</a> and  more details supplied in the CS101 Unit 1 Notes.</p>
<p><strong>Augusta Ada King</strong> (1815-1852)</p>
<p>Wrote what is considered to be the first algorithm designed for execution on a computing machine (Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine) for calculating Bernoulli numbers, hence she is credited as the first programmer. The computer language Ada is named in her honor. Referenced in <a href=""http://www.udacity.com/view#Course/cs101/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/2001/Nugget/4023"" rel=""nofollow"">Unit 1 - Ada</a> and  more details supplied in CS101 Unit 1 Notes.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Feynman</strong> (1918-1988)</p>
<p>Considered both a great physicist and teacher. Made fundamental contributions to quantum electrodynamics and theoretical physics. Well know for his pictorial representation of particle interactions known as Feynman diagrams. Won the Nobel prize in physics in 1965. Feynman gave, a now classic, talk on the prospects of what has grown into the field of nanotechnology. You can read his Nobel lecture <a href=""http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/feynman-lecture.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, and a transcript of his talk 'There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom' <a href=""http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/feynman.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.

<p><strong>Alan Turing</strong> (1912-1954)</p>
<p>Established several important concepts in computer science and mathematical logic. His 1936 paper '<em>On Computable Numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem</em>' introduced the concept of an abstract computing model which is now known as the Turing Machine. He also had important an influence on the fields of artificial intelligence ('<em>Computing machinery and intelligence in Mind</em>'), mathematical biology, and cryptanalysis.

When you do <code>get_page(page)</code>, you get the content (source) or the <code>page</code> URL, that may contain HTML formatting, text and URLs. In the <code>union(tocrawl,get_all_links(get_page(page)))</code> line the first thing that is done is <code>get_page(page)</code>, but instead of storing the returned value in a variable, the returned value is passed right into <code>get_all_links()</code> procedure. And after that, instead of storing the return value of the <code>get_all_links()</code>, the return value gets passed into the <code>union</code> function. If it makes it easier for you to understand, this line can be written as:</p>
<pre><code>page_content =  get_page(page)
links_in_page = get_all_links(page_content)
union(tocrawl, links_in_page)
</code></pre>
<p>But since we don't really need the variables <code>page_content</code> and <code>links_in_page</code>, these 3 lines can be written in a shorter way.</p>
<p>What <code>union</code> does is - it adds the <code>links_in_page</code> to <code>tocrawl</code> and then looks at the combined list and removes all duplicate entries and keeps only unique entries. So, for example, if <code>tocrawl = ['url1', 'url5']</code> and <code>links_in_page = ['url2', 'url5']</code>, then after <code>union</code> is called <code>tocrawl</code> will be <code>['url1', 'url5', 'url2']</code>, and not <code>['url1', 'url5', 'url2', 'url5']</code> (because 'url5' is duplicate, the second entry is removed)</p>"	"comment"	"2017973"	"2017952"	"2012-07-27 08:07:01.656338+00"	"1"	""	"2184354"	"100008518"	"2012-07-27 08:08:57.307511+00"	"2024873"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

"54388"	"Basic intro to recursion for those still battling with it"	"cs101 recursion tutorial basic"	"100008281"	"<p>Recursion is a nasty beast until you tame it, at which time it becomes your friend.  If you have not been able to grab it by the horns and are still battling with the basics, these two exercises should help you and take you all the way to solve most simple recursive problems, including all of the homework.</p>
<p>Dave pointed out that everything that you can do with a loop, you can do with recursion.  Then let's try it.  First, let's work with this function that prints the numbers from 1 to n:</p>
<pre><code>def print_numbers(n):
    i = 1
    while i &lt;= n:
        print i
        i = i+1
</code></pre>
<p>ok.. now recursively.  It you want to flex your muscles give it a try before looking at the explanation.  It should not take you more than a few minutes.</p>
<p>first you need your base case.  A condition for which you solve the problem inmediately is when n is 1.  Hence we have:</p>
<pre><code>def recursive_print_numbers(n):
    if n == 1:
        print n
        return
    else:
       &lt;treat the other cases&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This was easy because you focused on only a single case.. what to do if n = 1.</p>
<p>Now the recursive case.. you want to make the problem smaller each time that you call your function recursively:</p>
<pre><code>def recursive_print_numbers(n):
    if i == n:
        print n
        return
    else:
        recursive_print_numbers(n-1)
        print n
        return
</code></pre>
<p>So how do you come up with this?  you do the same thing that you did for the base case: you focus on a <strong>single case</strong>.  For the base case you focused on n=1.  for the recursive case you focus on the n-th case: assume that your recursive call of ""recursive_print_numbers(n-1)"" magically prints all the numbers from 1 to n-1.. what is left?  print n.  Those are exactly the 2 statements in the recursive case: a) reduced the problem and b) what to do after the reduced problem has been solved.  You are done.</p>
<p>Now taking into account the particular idiosincrasies of Python, your final code can do away with a number of lines:</p>
<pre><code>def recursive_print_numbers(n):
    if 1 == n:
        print n
        return
    recursive_print_numbers(n-1)
    print n
</code></pre>
<p>If you are struggling with recursion, the Python version looks much more mysterious that the ""generic"" version.  I would stick to adding returns and else statements until I fully understand what is going on.</p>
<p>Now for the next step.. the next level of complexity.  We now want to add the numbers from 1 to n instead of simply printing them:</p>
<pre><code>def sum_numbers(n):
    sum = 0
    i = 1
    while i &lt;= n:
        sum = sum + i
        i = i + 1
    return sum
</code></pre>
<p>This is a bit more complex because now, somehow, we need to carry information among the recursive calls. So let's see.. what is your base case? n = 1:</p>
<pre><code>def recursive_sum_numbers(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        &lt;recursive case&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now what is your recursive case?  Again, focus on what you need to do on the n-th case.. assume that your recursive call already added all the numbers from 1 to n-1 and is returning them to you.  All that is left do to is to add n and return:</p>
<pre><code>def recursive_sum_numbers(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        sum = recursive_sum_numbers(n-1)
        return sum + n
</code></pre>
<p>Done.  The information between recursive functions is passed in the return statement.  We recursively reduce the problem until n = 1 and only then we set the sum to one.  Then, as we return from the calls, each return contributes its own 'n' to sum.. i.e., the n-th return sets sum = 1, the (n-1) adds 2 to sum to make sum=3, the (n-2)th adds 3 to sum to make sum = 6, and so on, until the last return adds n and returns to the main caller.</p>
<p>If you fully understand these examples, you are now in a strong position to tackle the homework problems.  Good luck.</p>"	"question"	"\N"	"\N"	"2012-04-03 00:14:03.981096+00"	"2"	""	"172120"	"100005415"	"2012-04-04 11:35:23.98256+00"	"72039"	"\N"	"\N"	"826"	"f"

<p>You should go back and look at how you got the yob1995 file open.  You should then 'model' your imdb code so it is similar to the 'yob' code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Put the .py file for the imdb problem in the same directory as the .py file for the yob problem.</li>
<li>Put the .tsv file for the imdb problem in the same directory as the yob1995.txt file.</li>
<li>Make sure that the parameter to read_list in the yob problem is structured the same as the parameter to read_graph in the imdb problem.  Yes, the <em>names</em> of the files will be different, but if you didn't have a path for the yob problem you shouldn't have a path for the imdb problem.</li>
<li>Make SURE that you are spelling the name of the file correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since you were able to make the yob solution work, by following the steps above, your imdb data should be read in successfully.</p>

In previous sessions, we had semi-hard deadlines for homework.  Back then the 'rules' were pretty easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before the deadline, give hints/guidance.</li>
<li>After the deadline, share full solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>But now, with 'no deadlines', it's a lot harder to figure out what to do.  I haven't seen any real guidance from Udacity on this, so it seems that it is really up to us to blunder our way through.</p>
<p>Personally, I really DON'T want this to become an ego battle where people race to see who can post their solution first. (So far this hasn't been an issue.)  I'd rather see people wait at least four or five days from homework release before they post complete solutions.  But it's hard to even suggest this when the homework release dates aren't consistent from week to week.</p>
<p>So all I think we can do for now is to be careful to put 'spoiler' in the tags when we publish solutions.</p>
<p>As a final comment, I enjoy reading the solutions that other folks come up with... especially the ones that have a unique take/approach to the problem.</p>"	"comment"	"11003665"	"11003622"	"2012-07-27 02:37:42.673653+00"	"0"	""	"\N"	"100011294"	"2012-07-27 02:37:42.673653+00"	"11005664"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<pre><code>def rabbits(n):

    while month &lt;= n:
        if month &gt; 5:

        rabbitsA.append(newRabbits)

<p><strong>EDIT</strong><br>
Ahh, having carefully looked through your code, it is quite a clever way of keeping track of only the last five time periods, but I don't think it is so easy to read and it uses a lot of array operations (setting and re-setting). I don't know what that will mean for efficiency (and for a large value of 'n' my array size increases linearly, so it's all about trade-offs) But it works!

We are working on ways to make grading more resilient to these types of things, but unfortunately don't have that in place yet.

<p>First, my disclaimer: I think that all the people you name have been positive forces on the board. And I think that we are lucky to have you.</p>
<p>But, I think that the board can tend to be dominated by a couple of voices. This is hard to judge, because I personally tend to like those voices. But it kind of gives the impression that in order to understand the material well enough to answer questions you have to have already known it.</p>
<p>As for how Udacity should take this kind of board dynamics into account, I think they should continue with a fairly hands-off policy.</p>
<p>One of my concerns with the dominance of a couple of voices on this discussion board is that it leads people to trust authority over argument. In other words, I think that if a relatively unknown person posts an answer, that answer will be less likely to be believed and/or accepted until <a href=""http://forums.udacity.com/users/100008230/kenneth-i-laws-1"">@Ken</a> Laws or <a href=""http://forums.udacity.com/users/100017178/sergei"">@Sergei</a> (or a couple others) pop by to rule on it.</p>
<p>It's a great time and stress saver for people to have recognizable names on the forum who they can trust will give accurate answers. But when there's so few of them (relative to overall enrollment in the class) and most of them started out with the knowledge that the rest of us are here to pick up, the dynamic makes me a little uneasy.

When learning programming for the first or when learning a new language, I program a line at a time.  I check to make sure things are as I expect by setting break points or using print messages.  Tedious at first but saves debug time.  Once I get more comfortable, then I start writing entire functions (albeit I never write a function that has more than 4 or 5 lines of code).  Then I do the same as before, I test it out before moving on.  The more you practice the quicker all of this goes. In the beginning it will feel really slow.  </p>

<p>Unit 5 includes more information about the test suite which addresses some of my concerns.  I'm still not quite sure why he doesn't include the random tester in the test suite.  I can see that if you want your test suite to produce predictable results you don't to include the random tester.  But it seems finding bugs is more important than having a test suite that is constant -- always testing the same thing.  But then again, in following Unit 5, when a random tester comes up with a bug, the procedure is to pare down the testcase to the minimum that produces the problem.  That testcase can be added to the test suite.

<p>My take on it is this: </p>
<p>Udacity has to have some kind of business model. As publicly stated many times, that model is to reduce the cost of providing education to such a low level that the students can be offered the courses for nothing. </p>
<p>The profit comes in gathering information about the students and the way they do the courses. This information is useful in the recruitment industry, and in many other applications. Apart from the socially valuable goal of providing free education, this information is the whole point. Naturally, if Udacity is sold, this information is the mother lode and it is sold too. </p>
<p>Providing this information is how you are paying for your education. It's a price no higher than the price you pay for Facebook or Gmail.</p>
<p>The intellectual property of Udacity is the technology with which it provides the education. The autograding mechanism, in particular, is central to its ability to compete in this emerging marketplace. </p>
<p>As we have all discovered, when it doesn't work the students don't like it and consider taking their custom elsewhere. If you solve the autograding problem well, you're on the way to providing reliable certification from an online university. This achievement would mark a turning point, almost a singularity, in global access to education. </p>
<p>We shouldn't be surprised that this turning point hasn't quite happened yet. </p>
<p>We shouldn't be surprised that Udacity keeps fairly quiet about the details of the autograding mechanism. </p>
<p>We shouldn't be surprised that Udacity is reserving information about enrolments, graduations, and other details for publication at Udacity's convenience.</p>
<p>In conclusion, now that someone has found a way to provide a free education, there is no need to search for deep, dark, secret conspiracies.

<p>Regarding your first suggestion: I think the Run and Submit buttons do not have the same function. </p>
<p>The Run button runs the code you created, including any tests that you included, and prints anything your code says to print. It's the same as if you ran the code on your interpreter locally, with only the differences that might ensue from a different platform and Python version, and a limited run duration: the online interpreter stops if your program runs too long (thank goodness). <br>
This allows you to pick up any errors that you might have introduced when you cut and pasted your code, or incompatibility errors.</p>
<p>The Submit button hands the code onto the Auto Grader, which runs tests of its own, the details of which we may never know. So unless your tests exactly match those of the Auto Grader, you may see a difference in result from Run and Submit.</p>

I found some forum discussions to be too advanced for me, but there were other posts without which I would be completely lost in the course. Because ST101 is still experimental and new, there were some topics/hw/units that were confusing and not self-contained, and advanced students helped clarify those for all the other students.

<p>What is being said is this: this sudden glorious revolution in online education, pioneered by Khan Academy, Udacity and several established mainstream universities, is now gaining enough momentum to shift society in a more open and fair direction. </p>
<p>But there are two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The online course pioneers have not yet discovered how to offer you an education that takes no time and work on your part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They haven't yet completely shifted the Zeitgeist to the point where the online qualifications have the same chic as the qualifications from the old establishment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding Problem 1, I don't think it is going to be solved, until someone figures out how to induce connections directly in your brain. I'm happy to be a lab rat for this Udacity experiment, but I do not want to be involved in that one. </p>
<p>However it may be that solving Problem 2 will increase the likelihood that employers will offer support and paid time to do the online courses.</p>
<p>And am I wrong, or do courses like this usually take a semester? Didn't we just cut the time by something like seventy percent? And no commuting! No cafeteria food!</p>
<p>As for the second problem: <br>
This isn't a Problem, it's an Opportunity.</p>

The code runs fine in the Udacity interpreter in Chrome for Mac, it works for the various (some nefarious!) combinations I've listed at the bottom of this post, after the code. You may find the code verbose, but I've used only the tools taught prior to the HW in Q.</p>
<p>It's also worked for the cases given in <a href=""http://www.udacity-forums.com/cs101/questions/24512/hw38-sudoku-test-cases-lacking"" rel=""nofollow"">hw3.8: Sudoku test cases lacking </a> including those given in the 'accepted answer' by <a href=""http://www.udacity-forums.com/cs101/users/3812/keithe"" rel=""nofollow"">KeithE</a> and further edited by <a href=""http://www.udacity-forums.com/cs101/users/4872/jesyspa"" rel=""nofollow"">jesyspa</a>. I got the correct return even with the Jumbo Sudoku.<br>
(Needless to say, I'm getting that ""Incorrect. Your procedure did not return the correct value."" grader message.)</p>
<p>I am not satisfied with my analysis of Sudoku Theory concerning 'completeness' of my algorithm. Here's an example of the question, unanswered, in my mind: for a 9 x 9 Sudoku, the sum of all elements = 1+2+3 .......+9 = 45. Is there another combination of 9 different numbers that can still total 45 <strong>without repeating a number</strong>?</p>
<p>(confession, I changed the erroneous u=s(1) to u=s(0) in the 'create_col(s)' def below, so as to adress the case ([[1]]), I am thrilled at being able to work at this level and the power of changing just one digit!)</p>

This turns off stdout, then imports the entire program code, discarding output, then turns stdout back on.<br>
Then it just calls the function using a specified test suite.<br>
This uses the test cases from the assignment. </p>

"56990"	"Understanding recursion: the stack model"	"cs101 recursion tutorial"	"100005415"	"<p>Someone asked in <a href=""http://www.udacity-forums.com/cs101/questions/56878/asking-for-an-explantion-about-the-inner-workings-of-the-code-attached"" rel=""nofollow"">to explain the recursion in the following code</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Before we start</strong></p>
<pre><code>x = [1]
y = x
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, x and y refer to the exact same list.  If we call <strong>x.append(2)</strong>, then <strong>y</strong> is affected too.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<pre><code>x = [1]
y = x
y = y + [2]
</code></pre>
<p>After the third line, a new list is created, so <strong>y</strong> and <strong>x</strong> no longer refer to the same list.</p>
<p><strong>Now to the problem</strong> </p>
<p>Here's Peter's code again.  I've written line numbers on the left from L1 to L7 (line 1 to line 7)</p>
<pre><code>L1    def deep_count(p):
L2       sum = 0
L3       for e in p:
L4           sum = sum + 1
L5           if is_list(e):
L6               sum = sum + deep_count(e)
L7       return sum
</code></pre>
<p>We're going to trace the code (that is, step through the code, a line at a time, like the Python interpreter might.</p>
<p>We want to see what happens for <strong>deep_count([1, 3, [2, [7, 6], [], 5]])</strong>.</p>
<p>First, let's look at L2:</p>
<pre><code>sum = 0
</code></pre>
<p>This initializes the <strong>sum</strong>.</p>
<p>Next, let's look at this Lines 3-4:</p>
<pre><code>for e in p:
    sum = sum + 1
</code></pre>
<p><strong>e</strong> is either a non-list (a number or a string, typically) in which case it needs to be counted, or it is a <strong>list</strong> in which case the list needs to be counted (and later on its content).</p>
<p>This is the recursion magic (Lines 5-6):</p>
<pre><code>    if is_list(e):
        sum = sum + deep_count(e)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>deep_count(e)</strong> does a deep count of <strong>e</strong> and returns that value.  This is added to <strong>sum</strong>.</p>
<p>OK, here's the recursion magic.   Pay attention.</p>
<p><strong>Each time a recursive call is made, a copy of all the input and local variables are made</strong></p>
<p>Let's see this in action for the input: <strong>[1, 3, [2, [7, 6], [], 5]]</strong></p>
<p>Initially, after entering the for loop and doing <strong>sum = sum + 1</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(Initial recursive call) <strong>sum = 1, e = 1, p = [1, 3, [2, [7, 6], [], 5]]</strong> [After Line 4]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>e</strong> is not a list, so we go back to the top of the loop.</p>
<p>In the next iteration through</p>
<ul>
<li>(Initial recursive call) <strong>sum = 2, e = 3, p = [1, 3, [2, [7, 6], [], 5]]</strong> [After Line 4]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>sum</strong> is incremented by 1, <strong>e</strong> is 3, which is not a list, so we go back up to the top of the for loop.</p>
<p>In this next iteration,</p>
<ul>
<li>(Initial recursive call) <strong>sum = 3, e = [2, [7, 6], [], 5], p = [1, 3, [2, [7, 6], [], 5]]</strong> [After Line 4]</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>sum</strong> already counts the list (so even if it's empty, it gets counted).</p>
<p>At this point <strong>e</strong> is a list, so a recursive call is made.  In this call, a new <strong>p</strong> is created (set to <strong>[2, [7, 6], [], 5]</strong>), a new <strong>sum</strong> is created, initialized to 0, and we loop.</p>
<p>I'll write it like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Initial recursive call) <strong>sum = 3, e = [2, [7, 6], [], 5], p = [1, 3, [2, [7, 6], [], 5]]</strong> [At Line 6]</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(2nd recursive call) <strong>sum = 0, p = [2, [7, 6], [], 5]</strong> [After Line 2]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice there are two copies of <strong>sum</strong>.  We always use the one on the bottom.</p>
<p>When we reach the <strong>for</strong> loop and increment <strong>sum</strong>, we get:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Initial recursive call) <strong>sum = 3, e = [2, [7, 6], [], 5], p = [1, 3, [2, [7, 6], [], 5]]</strong> [At Line 6]</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(2nd recursive call) <strong>sum = 1, e = 2, p = [2, [7, 6], [], 5]</strong> [After Line 4]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We go back to the top of the loop (since <strong>e</strong> is not a list). In the next iteration <strong>e</strong> is <strong>[7, 6]</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Initial recursive call) <strong>sum = 3, e = [2, [7, 6], [], 5], p = [1, 3, [2, [7, 6], [], 5]]</strong> [At Line 6]</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(2nd recursive call) <strong>sum = 2, e = [7,6], p = [2, [7, 6], [], 5]</strong> [After Line 4]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>e</strong> is a list, so we make a third recursive call.  Another copy of <strong>p</strong> is made (set to <strong>[7, 6]</strong>) and another copy of <strong>sum</strong> is created.  Let's jump into the loop for that call</p>
<ul>
<li>(Initial recursive call) <strong>sum = 3, e = [2, [7, 6], [], 5], p = [1, 3, [2, [7, 6], [], 5]]</strong> [At Line 6]</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(2nd recursive call) <strong>sum = 2, e = [7,6], p = [2, [7, 6], [], 5]</strong> [After Line 4]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(3rd recursive call) <strong>sum = 1, e = 7, p = [7, 6]</strong> [After Line 4]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>e</strong> is not a list, so go back to the top of loop, set <strong>e</strong> to 6, increment <strong>sum</strong> to 2,</p>
<ul>
<li>(Initial recursive call) <strong>sum = 3, e = [2, [7, 6], [], 5], p = [1, 3, [2, [7, 6], [], 5]]</strong> [At Line 6]</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(2nd recursive call) <strong>sum = 2, e = [7,6], p = [2, [7, 6], [], 5]</strong> [After Line 4]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(3rd recursive call) <strong>sum = 2, e = 6, p = [7, 6]</strong> [After Line 4]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice, we have three copies of <strong>sum</strong>, three copies of <strong>e</strong>.  We are done processing the list <strong>[7, 6]</strong> and return 2.  </p>
<p>We remove the third line because we have completed the third recursive call.</p>
<p>The 2 is added in the code in the second recursive call (Line 6):</p>
<pre><code>sum = sum + deep_count(e)
</code></pre>
<p>where <strong>e</strong> was <strong>[7, 6]</strong> from the second recursive call.  So <strong>sum</strong> gets 2 more added to it to total 4.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Initial recursive call) <strong>sum = 3, e = [2, [7, 6], [], 5], p = [1, 3, [2, [7, 6], [], 5]]</strong> [At Line 6]</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(2nd recursive call) <strong>sum = 4, e = [7,6], p = [2, [7, 6], [], 5]</strong> [After Line 6]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, back to the top of the loop, <strong>sum</strong> gets incremented from 4 to 5, <strong>e</strong> is set to <strong>[]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(Initial recursive call) <strong>sum = 3, e = [2, [7, 6], [], 5], p = [1, 3, [2, [7, 6], [], 5]]</strong> [At Line 6]</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(2nd recursive call) <strong>sum = 5, e = [], p = [2, [7, 6], [], 5]</strong> [After Line 4]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>e</strong> is a list, so we make a recursive call.  In this case, a new <strong>p</strong>, and <strong>sum</strong> are created.  <strong>p</strong> is <strong>[]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(Initial recursive call) <strong>sum = 3, e = [2, [7, 6], [], 5], p = [1, 3, [2, [7, 6], [], 5]]</strong> [At Line 6]</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(2nd recursive call) <strong>sum = 5, e = [], p = [2, [7, 6], [], 5]</strong> [After Line 4]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(3rd recursive call) <strong>sum = 0, p = []</strong> [After Line 2]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since <strong>p</strong> is empty, we don't go through the <strong>for</strong> loop, and merely return <strong>sum</strong> which is 0.</p>
<p>We add 0 to the <strong>sum</strong> of the second recursive call.  This means <strong>sum</strong> is unchanged at 5.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Initial recursive call) <strong>sum = 3, e = [2, [7, 6], [], 5], p = [1, 3, [2, [7, 6], [], 5]]</strong> [At Line 6]</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(2nd recursive call) <strong>sum = 5, e = [], p = [2, [7, 6], [], 5]</strong> [After Line 6]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Back to the top of the loop, and <strong>e</strong> is set to 5, we increment <strong>sum</strong> to 6.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Initial recursive call) <strong>sum = 3, e = [2, [7, 6], [], 5], p = [1, 3, [2, [7, 6], [], 5]]</strong> [At Line 6]</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(2nd recursive call) <strong>sum = 6, e = 5, p = [2, [7, 6], [], 5]</strong> [After Line 4]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No more elements in this list.  We return <strong>sum</strong> which is 6.  This gets added to the <strong>sum</strong> from the first recursive call (in the line <strong>sum = sum + deep_count(e)</strong>.  <strong>sum</strong> is now 3 + 6 or 9.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Initial recursive call) <strong>sum = 9, e = [2, [7, 6], [], 5], p = [1, 3, [2, [7, 6], [], 5]]</strong> [At Line 6]</li>
</ul>
<p>We go back to the top of the loop in the first recursive call.  There are no more elements left in the list, so we do <strong>return sum</strong> (at Line 7) which has 9, and that is the answer.</p>
<p><strong>The Stack Model</strong></p>
<p>This is the ""stack"" model.  Each recursive call creates a new set of local variables.  This does not necessarily <em>copy</em> the values in the variables, but merely points to them (thus variables from different recursive calls could refer to the same, say, list).  <strong>sum</strong> is, however, created up to 3 times in our example, each with its own number (since numbers are immutable).</p>
<p>This wasn't explained in the lectures, presumably because they thought they could avoid this discussion.  To be fair, most books don't cover it like this, but I like to, because it's not obvious, for example, that there are multiple <strong>sum</strong> variables.</p>
<p>The stack model works with any procedure, not just recursive methods.</p>
<p>Here's some simple code</p>
<pre><code>L1 def sum(x, y):
L2     return x + y

L3 def doublePlusOne(n):
L4     val = sum(n, n) + 1
L5     return val
</code></pre>
<p>Suppose we call <strong>doublePlusOne(10)</strong>.  We start at Line 4</p>
<ul>
<li>(doublePlusOne) n = 10</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, this calls <strong>sum(10, 10)</strong> (we plug in 10 to n).  This then calls <strong>sum</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(doublePlusOne) <strong>n = 10</strong> {Line 4]</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(sum) <strong>x = 10, y = 10</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We return <strong>x + y</strong> which is <strong>10 + 10</strong> or 20.  We were in the middle of <strong>sum(n, n) + 1</strong>.  The <strong>sum(n, n)</strong> evaluated to 20, so we add <strong>20 + 1</strong> to get 21.</p>
<p>We get,</p>
<ul>
<li>(doublePlusOne) <strong>n = 10, val = 21</strong> [After Line 5]</li>
</ul>
<p>So the stack model works on <em>any</em> procedure call, not just recursive ones.</p>"	"question"	"\N"	"\N"	"2012-04-05 01:23:09.239437+00"	"12"	""	"181138"	"100019242"	"2013-04-04 02:41:00.780885+00"	"76302"	"\N"	"\N"	"1077"	"f"
